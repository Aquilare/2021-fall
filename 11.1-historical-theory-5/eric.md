I think one would have to go back to their empirical historian roots. When it comes to a particular question of what happened during this event, then it could reasonably be answered through a historian’s research and educated conclusions. People can ask a historical question about anything, and they will get the answer the most reasonable from the available evidence. It might not be “exactly as it was” but it can be reasoned that it is mostly “correct” through the historian’s knowledge of the subject matter they are writing about.

A historian can be the expert of a certain subject, but it does not mean they are an eternal fountain of knowledge. They may take a take a scientific approach which makes their work “correct” but they will have to be honest and make proclamations that what they write is not the “whole truth “.

The next question might be “but can we say the history is ‘correct’ when we a member visits a museum or historical site with reenactors?”

It is a yes and no answer. Many places with educational and historical missions have a duty to draw in patrons as well. It can be assumed that a museum will do its best when it comes to creating exhibits with as much detail as possible, but the museum is also trying to attract as many visitors as they can. The museum may leave out certain aspects to make an exhibit acceptable and understandable to people of all ages. Simply put, a museum is not in the business in being 100% historically accurate. Museums are there to make people think and be the jumping off point for them to do further research on their own.

But what is truth? Are historians objective?

Truth in history can only go so far. Even if the historian was there at the time they were writing about, they will not have the entire truth. Similar to an autobiography, a historian will write about what they know but there will be facts that are left out to make themselves look better or there will be facts about their life that were keep from them so they will make reasonable assertions to fit the truth of what happened.

Historians will cite their sources which seems like a reasonable practice to prove to the reader that what they are reading is object but that does not always make one work about a topic truer than another. The evidence they are citing to supposed to speak for itself, but the historian is writing with a purpose in mind. A historian should try to remain neutral, but they are not infallible. They can interpret their own evidence incorrectly because they misunderstood the language being used or the context in which it was written.

Fullbrook cites a lot of other historians, about their critiques of historical writing but is there truly a controversy among historians about their work? Like is there a battle “raging” between college professors on the way they interpreted and wrote a history?

How can a historian write an objective history if a government, which generally holds the power, says an even happened a different way than what the historian writes?
