*[FRIEND is asking about about historical representation.]*

**ME**:  Well, it’s not such an easy debate to present one side as better or more factual than the other.  Historians have to draw their conclusions from the sources that are made available to them.  We both know what it means to research a topic that you are writing a paper on.  Often, I have to read and sort through scholarly works that either apply or don’t to what I need in terms of what evidence I have to reinforce a thesis question that I’ve asked.  This is the same for professional historians in that they are working from a particular framework and have chosen a specific question or set of questions to try and answer.

**FRIEND**:  But doesn’t that mean that the historian has a clear picture of a narrative they want to use when researching their subject?  Why would you believe that they are presenting a totally truthful account of something?  The crazy postmodernist really has a point about how much historians impose on their historical accounts.

**ME**: I can see your point.  Mary Fulbrook argues that we would not want to read or participate in historical research if the accounts rendered are sets of dry and mind-numbing unconnected facts and dates.  Writing history necessarily means that historians must be creative in how they choose to connect the information they gather, and organize it in such a way that makes it both appealing and relevant to our present circumstances.

**FRIEND**: How would an historian not be making up some of the narrative they write about then?  What if they don’t have all the information they need to connect the dots and they just fill in the gaps with their own opinions or conjectures?

**ME**: Fulbrook says that we can never have an exact copy of the past to be able to render again for the present.  Rather, she emphasizes that the way the historian presents the information they find is the most critical part of writing history, and that this should be open to rational debate.  The methods that a scholar uses to write about history should not be unquestionable, and what they write about also has to make sense for the subject they are discussing and the audience they are writing for.

**FRIEND**:  That still doesn’t really answer how we should expect historians to accurately portray the past and why they use so much imagination in their writings.

**ME**:  You have totally valid points because the answers to those things aren’t necessarily cut and dry.  This is again what Fulbrook states, the choices made about the forms and purposes of representing history will affect the results and how they are rendered.  If you are asking questions that have subject matter and source relevancy, you would essentially be able to write about the historical nature of your research without having to theorize or guess at the missing info.  If you just don’t have the information, you should tell your audience.  Transparency about the lack of historical knowledge isn’t a terrible thing.  Fulbrook wants people to know that literary form is important, but is simply a means to conveying the content of your research.

**FRIEND**:  So confusing……

**ME**: Yep, but reading Fulbrook has really helped me to understand how important it is to think about history and historical thinking much more critically.  I have really had to work to appreciate what she is saying.

*[FRIEND just asked about objectivity and appeals to evidence.]*

**ME**:  Just because an author or historian has a ton of footnotes does not necessarily mean that they narrative they present is more objective.  It’s totally possible that research can “look” or “seem” like it is legitimate just because it has lengthy references and sources cited.  I don’t think that necessarily means that it is completely objective.  

**FRIEND**:  But doesn’t that mean that an historian has done an extensive amount of research and really knows their subject well?  Why would that discount being objective?
**ME**: Anybody can cite and reference a ton of things, what really matters is how those findings are presented and we should always be critical of the author’s intentions and what their ultimate goal is.  Fulbrook makes the case that objectivity doesn’t necessarily come from a position of authority on a particular topic, or that just because a researcher incorporates several different competing narratives into their account that means that somehow they are being objective.  She also discussed how political motivations of the historian can affect the very history that they study, the questions they ask, and ultimately what conclusions they draw from their evidence.  Basically, to be truly objective, an historian needs to be able to render their findings in a way that is open to debate and can be rationally discussed and, if necessary, discarded if found to be biased or untruthful. 

**FRIEND**: I’m not quite sure I understand.  You mean that no matter how the historian writes, what they write about, or what they personally believe in, their ideas should be open to debate?  How would this make their ideas any more objective?

**ME**:  If they are open-minded enough to allow their ideas and findings to be debated, then I think it means that they are open to objective ideas of accuracy and should be able to handle critique of their work.  Putting your research out there and disallowing for debate or conflict about your ideas means that you are not willing to embrace objectivity, that just because you say something is true is the end of the story.  That wouldn’t be fair or rational since humans are totally fallible and we should always be willing to acknowledge that.  They should also consider acknowledging their own personal perceptions and values so that they can present transparency to their audience too.

**FRIEND**:  Oh, I see what you mean.  You have to be able to handle criticism of your findings in order to present something that is objective.  This Mary Fulbrook sounds like a tough debater, but she does raise some interesting points.

*Questions I still have:*

Fulbrook admits her own writings are constructed on a paradigm.  Would it be better if all historians conceded to this idea and were open about?

How have the political debates surrounding objectivity in historical research changed in the last 20 years since Fulbrook’s book was published?
