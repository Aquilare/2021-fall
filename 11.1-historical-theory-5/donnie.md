# Historical Convesation
## _Two friends in a coffee shop, talking Folbrook_



I agree, every good story, the bad ones too, have been told with a little bit of imagination. The pieces of history, those primary sources, and secondary reactions, are tools used by the historian to understand a place in time.  

Fulbrook in no way says that we can not understand history. She does say however, that we need to understand the historian and that individualâ€™s approach to the study of history before we conclude what is fact and what is story. 

In her example of historical places becoming entertainment spots, she notes the actors who portray a certain supposed style or a way of talking are doing so to understand in a way that takes the events and wraps around them conceivable concepts. We have no idea if this is how someone of the time spoke, but this social construct helps bring understanding to the way of life for that area and time. This is an example of people making history easy on themselves to understand, but it may not be an accurate view of the way life was. 

Fulbrook says the reader gives too much credit to the integrity of the work without concerning themselves over the idea that a large amount of the work may be theory. 
How one historian chooses to represent the past, and often their framework, is one of the present. Often, we try to make sense of the past within our current needs. It is an understanding relevant to us. Stories are told because they could have happened this way and we have evidence to back this theory up. That is the point of each historian and the job of the reader to understand when approaching the past and history as a vital subject.  

I think Fulbrook would conclude that history is a living being.  Something that is constructed and revised for each person looking back.



- Can paradigms offer a more complete story?
