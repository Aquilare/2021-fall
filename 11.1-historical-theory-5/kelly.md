# Historical Theory Chapter 8: Representing the Past #

ME: Well… no, friend, it isn’t reasonable critiques because historians don’t inherently represent the past more than they really can because a good study of history and representation will have decent amount of weight to it, with citations and evidence to back it up. Historians cannot just write whatever they want to write without providing any evidence to prove that what they are saying happen. It’s like writing an augmentative essay; you have a claim you’re trying to make, need to provide evidence (or in this case historical textual evidence), use that evidence to support your argument, but a historian *must* tell history as it is, not as they want it to be.

FRIEND: But how do you explain the way historians have imposed their bias, or personal narrative, on accounts of the past? Wouldn’t that just cancel out what you just said?

ME: Okay, yeah, it’s been believed that there is this idea of “the unreliable narrator.” But also, have you read a something that purely historical account—just historical fact, on a timeline, telling you exactly as is?
FRIEND: Yeah, that’s boring, I don’t think anyone really wants to read that.

ME: *likes reading purely historical fact/texts* I think some people might like that… but Mary Fulbrook would agree with you—no one wants a copy and paste history. Would you not agree then that a historical account is written because there is a question that needs to be answered, a puzzle that needs to be solved, or particular points in history that need to be seen?

FRIEND: Well, yes, that’s what basically keeps the subject of history booming. Doesn’t that drive come from the imagination of historians though? Like, don’t they just make some things up to “fit” their narrative?

ME: Mary Fulbrook and I must disagree with that; yes, for a story to take shape you kind of need plot, character, and voice—but it is important that historians be clear to the audience what they are doing with that plot, character, and voice. 

FRIEND: Okay… but what if a historian doesn’t do that? Also, doesn’t “telling a good story” mean you’d inherently tell lies to make the story *really* good?

ME: Yes and no. Historians, *good* historians, should let their readers know what they’re doing when writing a history. They should let their audience know within which paradigm/framework/narrative they’re working within. That’s the responsible thing to do. And sure, “telling a good story” especially when it comes to a *history* means you’re going to embellish, but **transparency** is always key. It’s why movies that are “*based* on a true story”, “*based* on actual events”, “*inspired* by a true story” and “*inspired* by actual events” are stated in movie credits before or after the movie, **transparency**.

# Historical Theory Chapter 9: History and Partisanship #

ME: Look, I love a good footnote in a book, but… that will not mean that there is more objectivity. Just means that there is more out there to be explored. But that doesn’t mean that just because a historical account has more sources or citations it has more weight than other historical accounts.

FRIEND: Yeah, but you were just saying that historians need to provide evidence for what they’re saying to be a good historian?

ME: Yes, but just because a 10-page research paper has 30+ citations does not mean that it’s legit. Those citations can be misconstrued, used by the historian to make their point, appeal to *their* version of history, which takes us back to our original conversation.

FRIEND: Well, what the hell?

ME: Welcome to historiography, we meet on Mondays and Wednesdays.

FRIEND: Okay, well… using what we discussed earlier the answer to the question of objectivity is…

ME & FRIEND: Transparency!

ME: And along with transparency, we as readers need to do our job and be critical of what we are reading. That’s why Fulbrook is writing this book, she’s telling us that in order to be good historians we must constantly be critical of what we’re reading, who we’re reading, and whether they are being critical of what they’re writing and being transparent about that writing. We need to understand that a lot of historians have (and will continue) worked in certain paradigms/frameworks/narratives that will fit into the historian’s personal sphere. It won’t always happen, sometimes it can be uncoupled from a historian’s writing/research… but that’s why we constantly question.

FRIEND: Dude, I’m not going to lie to you… that’s hard, why can’t history just be… easy?

ME: Well, history isn’t easy friend. It’s a rough thing to study, to research, to write about. And that is a good thing—history is not copy and paste; it can’t be, there are too many pieces for there to be just **one** history. All of history is one puzzle, and everything we learn is contributed to that puzzle, we’re just continuing to add to the puzzle.

FRIEND: I don’t really like that analogy…

ME: Neither do I, but it works… for now.
