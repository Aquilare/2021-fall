Chapter 8

In chapter 8 we see Fulbrook talk about the aims and forms of Historical writing and it takes on many shapes from trying to entertain and to inform and to argue. Fulbrook later goes on to say that “for centuries a primary purpose of public historical reconstruction and commemoration has been emotive.” (146) It’s been used by to tell tales of great heroes and the amazing deeds that they have done. This emotive nature of Historical writing could have been done to prop up institutions or even to show off the artistic flair of artists who are creating emotive narratives against policies of the state like protesting a war for example. Fulbrook later goes on to say that the cashing in on History for purely entertainment value Historians “while generally and intentionally imaginative treatment of historical themes for creative purposes can provide all manner of insights the growth of the “history business” as part of tourism can also produce the most banal moralizing (and also in many ways inaccurate) representations. (148) This is where the problem lies with Historians being too creative or taking too many liberties with the subject matter that those accounts to the audience taking these themes and ideas from the historians began to take them as authentic and taking the voice away from the people the historian is talking about. 

Chapter 9

In Chapter 9 we should all be aware the “appeal to evidence” fallacy because Fulbrook is saying that we need to be aware of biases even when they are claiming to be objective and unbiased. Fulbrook spoke on the issue of bias and said that historical writing is often thought of as an individualistic position where the Historian has to confess their personal beliefs in order to attain more neutrality. Here Fulbrook has “5 respects” for an individual historian to look. We have Empathy vs Sympathy where Fulbrook says having an emphatic lens is best. Insider knowledge (worms eye view) or look at privileged access, Emotional Investment partisanship on your account. Honesty of Dishonesty or how blind you are to certain aspects of the account you are writing about, and the choice of theoretical approach or paradigm. “Empathy should be viewed as a neutral tool for understanding mentalities, quite unrelated to that of sympathy or otherwise of the historian’s motives of those views he or she is trying to understand.” (167) Fulbrook makes the point with empathy Fulbrook goes on about each of the five respects to become more neutral in historical writing.
