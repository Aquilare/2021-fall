### Historical Theroy 4
The issue at hand is that historians are putting together a representation of the past and that representation changes depending on the way it is being used. Historians are not trying to make an exact copy of a lost past. Historical text generally tries to tell an accurate account, now just because they have to fill in the blanks does not mean that its fiction it is a historical representation and is not some complete work. So, what most historians attempt to do is not to seek to reproduce a story in the past, but it is an argument, and they are presenting a possible answer to the puzzle. This means that Historians are not putting a correct narrative these gaps in knowledge allows for them to have discussions about those gaps. 

Now for the using imaginations the historian is not using imaginations but rather a possible account of how things came to be in the present. And yes, Historians do construct the story but even in this everything can be constructed differently but they also are looking at two different things. It again comes down to what the historian is looking at because the entire story from the actors to the plot changes depending on what the historical question is being asked.

The issue I have with how history is portrayed is not in text but more in the realm of monuments and museums. Now yes, I know that they have entertaining purposes and can even spark imaginations to ask new questions. Museums for example normally have only one main narrative that it is showing the public. Fullbrook brings up the differences of the Holocaust museums, but another example would be the nuclear museum here in Albuquerque having a completely different narrative then the museum in Hiroshima. 

The more footnotes does not mean that that book is more objective. You have to take into account many different things that you have to think about. The first being that you have to get to know the historian whose work you are reading and what their personal bias are. Another thing is that when you are reading the work you have to ask yourself is the historian using empathy to get into the mindset of protagonist of the work or are being epithetic to the protagonist. The next thing is to see if the historian is being honest and not warping the evidence to fit the story that they are telling. You also have to be aware of the paradigm that the historian is using because it shapes all points but even the choice of paradigms and political choice have influences on the historical inquiry.  But in all objectivity is not in the work or in the individual historian but in the discussion that they are having. 








### Questions 
Should museums only tell one narrative and if they can tell more what are the implications of doing so?

Do you think museums and memorials are somewhat at fault for the public belief in one narrative over another narrative?
