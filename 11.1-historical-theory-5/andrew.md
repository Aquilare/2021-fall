# Reflections on Fulbrook, Historical Theory V

**Friend:** How can we be sure of the past if there are so many different representations of it? 

__AS:__ Well the variety historical representations is a factor of differing purposes for producing history. Some representations exist to foster a sense of national identity, others to spur empathy or human connection with people of the past, and some exist simply to entertain the masses. It’s important to understand that historical representation is the form history takes, which is distinct from the historical content or knowledge contained therein. For instance, some towns like Tombstone, AZ or Salem, MA have become tourist attractions and quasi-monuments because of their history. These places usually offer a kind of interactive experience with history as tourists walk the same streets once roamed by cowboys or alleged witches, but the information a tourist gathers from these places is the actual historical knowledge being imparted. Historical representations vary based on the target audience, so while Hamilton can teach millions of theater fans about the American Revolution, Assassins Creed II can teach millions of gamers about the Italian Renaissance. The representation of history is really just a vehicle for content, historical knowledge, which can be critiqued separately for its degree of accuracy. 

**Friend:** I see, but how can we trust any of the content within a historical representation if all historians imbue their work with their own bias and sentiments?  

**AS:** In line with that question, many postmodern critics have argued that no historian can truly serve as a reliable narrator given that they will no doubt introduce their personal bias, agenda, and sentiments into their construction of the past. While this charge is true on many accounts, to use the reality of human bias to delimit the value of history in totality is, I believe, an absurd leap in logic. For of course historical representations are going to be somewhat biased and selective – that’s precisely what a representation is. Historians are not seeking to present audiences with a perfect copy of the past that encompasses everything, nor present themselves as omniscient narrators that know everything. All representations, historical or otherwise, are selected features of a larger whole chosen for their utility in the context of a particular project. Thus, while the postmodern criticism of representation invokes healthy skepticism of history, the extension of that criticism to write-off all representation as effectively useless is premised on a strawman. 

**Friend:** But isn’t so much of the production of history a creative process? How can we derive any kind of reliable truth about the past from a single induvial creative storytelling? 

**AS:** While much the historian’s task is creative, it would be overstepping to assume that all history amounts to fictious storytelling. The production of history does involve many literary aspects decided by historians, such as the assignment of roles (hero, villain, victim), the construction of a coherent timeline (beginning, middle, and end), or the choice to add or remove agency and voice from certain actors within the narrative. Each of the aforementioned techniques are done in an effort to make history engaging for readers – I mean, who would want to read history if every book was nothing but a list of dry historical facts presented out of context? All this being said, those who focus too deeply on the literary aspects of history lose sight of the fact that historical representation does not necessarily determine the accuracy or truth value of the content within a given representation. 
To put it more succinctly, we can still parse out genuine insights and concerning falsehoods among the various differing representations of history. The value of a good piece of advice is not lessened by its framing as a metaphor, and neither is the historical knowledge contained within some representations of the past diminished simply because of the format in which that knowledge is contained.

**Friend:** How does objectivity play into all this? It seems like the more footnotes a book has, the more objective it is. Is that right?

**AS** Well, not exactly. Many historians might claim that their ultimate goal is to get as close to the truth as possible, even if attaining the complete truth is nigh-impossible. For a long time now, having lots of footnotes and evidence to point to has been a way for historians to claim that their historical writing is valid and objective. However, simply accumulating lists of sources that reinforce your argument is reality meaningless without offering readers your precise rationale for why you chose those sources and how exactly they support your argument in particular. Without doing so, existing biases held by historians are simply transplanted into their footnotes. 

**Friend:** Oh I see, so as long as historians are honest about their choice of evidence and existing biases, their work can be seen as more objective?

**AS** Again, not exactly. Being transparent and open about one’s biases and subsequent selection of evidence, or to put in a word – their paradigms – is a good start to fostering a better understanding of how valid certain histories are. However, simply being honest about bias within a piece of historical writing does not increase the objectivity of the work in question. Max Weber suggested that “values be left at the door of inquiry,” but doing so is functionally impossible when one considers how much influence partisan relationships tend to have on the writing of history. Beyond competing historical narratives generated by partisan conflict, even the type of history differs depending on the political inclinations of those writing (ex. structural histories tend to be produced by left-wing writers while individual micro-narratives are more commonly produced by right-wing writers). So unfortunately, historians will always be limited in their ability to objectively represent the past, due in large part to their personal political sentiments. 

**Friend:** So how can be decide between which histories are more objective or truthful than others if all historians are hamstrung by their own personal political beliefs? 

**AS** Good question. We’ve already discussed how part of the solution is for historians to explicitly state the paradigms under which they’re operating, which would include their political preferences and decision to select certain types of evidence. In a larger sense, however, we ought to dispel with the idea of objectivity that we currently employ. The notion that some histories are inherently better than others because their authors possess a higher degree of objective truth about the past has resulted in gatekeeping history and closing off lines of history inquiry. Instead, we ought to embrace the concept of public debate. Historians ought to present their case for why their work is accurate or truthful, take in criticism, and revise thusly. It’s only through fostering this kind of discourse between historians that we can begin to learn about the past from beyond the narrow viewpoint of any one historian. _Truth is to be found not in the voice of a single authority, but in the collective effort to resolve disagreements and misunderstandings._ 

**Friend:** Woah...
