Friend: How do we really know what happened in the past?  

 

Me: I would imagine that just about every postmodernist historian would argue that we simply aren’t able to really know for one hundred percent certain what happened in the “actual past.” My historiography professor really likes to drive this point home to really ensure that I simply can no longer carry a childlike enthusiasm for history! Naturally this question requires the differentiation between past and history. With the past of course being what actually happened, and history being our retelling of it through different paradigms, lenses, and perspectives. Arguably, “really knowing what happened in the past” would mean basing history on every single, individual, viewpoint, lens, and paradigm for every single part of history. Naturally this is completely impossible as we simply cannot tell what some random unnamed horseman was thinking while charging into battle; or what the exact thoughts were of the founding fathers as they signed the Declaration of Independence. For that reason, a smart kid in my class who is probably better at math than me explained that “reaching historical understanding is like a mathematical limit in that we can always push closer to the historical “truth” but can never actually reach it.”  

 

Friend: How can anyone possibly portray it accurately?  

 

Me: As the impeccable historiographer once said, “Both as individuals and as members of different forms of collective community, humans think and act in ways patterned and conditioned by selective perceptions and reappropriations of multiple pasts.” This of course alludes to the fact that as imperfect humans we place our biases and perspectives on history. Naturally these are derivatives of our personal experiences and several other contributing factors. Of course, at the end of the day, in black and white terms, this makes history nothing more than the telling of a story. Clearly, we don’t live in a black and white world, so the question should’ve been how can we more accurately portray history as it is simply impossible to completely accurately portray history. The answer to this would be to attempt to be unbiased and paint history through as many as lenses and paradigms as possible. Furthermore, Fullbrook offers that historians should be upfront with their biases and explain through what paradigm they are attempting to tell their historical history.  

 

And don’t historians have to use a lot of imagination to tell a good story? 

 

Me: Naturally, to tell a good story anyone would have to use a lot of imagination. Of course, “telling a good story” is often considered to be one of the worst ways to tell history in terms of accuracy. One has to realize however that without at least some splash of storytelling history is nothing more than a list of bullet point battles, people, places, etc. As humans we need some form of story to be able to actually engaged with history and absorb lessons that the historian is trying to convey. At the end of the day this makes history not real in the way you want it to be and everything is a lie. <3 

 

 

 

Friend: It seems like the more footnotes a book has, the more objective it is. Is that right? 

 

Me: I would argue that while the more footnotes the more academic a book is, however, academic inclination and objectivity or two different things. Clearly the best way to show this is through a polar extreme in a historian putting words in someone's mouth, manipulating the context of a certain quote. In that way they can cite as many authors as they would like, but at the end of the day objectivity can be completely missing from a book even if the bibliography is twenty pages. Fullbrook offers that “before you read the history, know the historian.” This lends itself to the concept of the multiplicity of history. This is essentially that history has endless “endpoints” and ways in which to reach these end points. I would argue that individual authors compose one of the many different ways to interpret and understand history.  

 

In this sense we can understand objectivity is extremely difficult to either quantify or qualify. We can see this in the question of who gets to write who’s history? On the one hand the argument can be made that anyone should be able to write on any culture's history. However, in some cases it can be entirely possible that a historian could apply their own lens and perspectives to another culture's history and devalue aspects of that culture. On the other hand, letting only those who are members of a certain culture could be detrimental as well in that they might feel a certain sense of pride in their culture and might overvalue certain aspects of that culture. In seeking to eliminate all chances for non-objectivity this line of thinking leads to the conclusion that a historian could only write their own biography as fullbrook puts it.  

The manner in which the historian writes also makes a difference in the level of objectivity in their writing. For example, in writing a more traditional view of history one can focus more on an individual and their motivations; essentially how one singular person made an impact. More liberal forms of history often focus more on structural or class motivations and actions.
