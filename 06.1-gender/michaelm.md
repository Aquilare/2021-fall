   It’s clear that the argument is not simply that historians should pay more attention to women in history, but rather that historians are missing an important piece of context in their historical investigations by neglecting half the human population. As noted in the article, just as one cannot write a complete history of class by only focusing on the peasants, one cannot write a complete history, period, without acknowledging not just “the other” gender but all manifestations of gender - including the neuter or genderless.

   According to the article, feminist historians are not simply historians writing histories about women, but are rather historians writing with women in mind alongside men as agents of change in their own right, whose ideas and actions are linked through social structures, responsibilities, and societal expectations to those of men and are thus integral to understanding history. In writing about “gender” and not “women,” then, feminist historians make the claim that women’s histories are not a separate realm from the world of men, but are part and parcel, indelibly linked. This is contrary to the traditional view of “sex” and “sexual difference” as denoting instrinsic separation between the sexes by virtue of biological differences.
    
   The author of the article claims that what is needed is a theory of gender relations in history, so as to avoid outdated social theories that separate the genders into disparate boxes. In her discussion of Marxist theory, the author makes it clear how Marxist-feminist theories of gender relations are fundamentally rooted in “social” (by which writers often mean economic), materialist relations centered around modes of production, and how this leaves gender without any independent framwork of analysis.
    
   Object-relations theories are dismissed by the author for failing to take into account symbolic systems of gender construction, instead relying predominantly on the division of labor within the household. A focus on the “lived experience” of women morphs into an understanding of women’s issues as basically essentialist - arising as a result of the lived experience of women, plural, and not the woman, singular. Structuralist and post-structuralist understandings are found useful in the characterization of gender as being in a constant process of reshaping and construction, but fall short as perpetuation of “the air of constancy of sexual polarity” as it reinforces sexual antagonism and polarity as timeless aspects of the human condition.
    
   The fundamental argument of this essay is embodied here: “Instead of a search for single origins, we have to conceive of processes so interconnected that they cannot be disentangled.”
    
   The author’s theory of gender is based on the idea of gender as a constructed social relationship dependent on social imagination regarding perceived sexual differences, and also on the idea of gender being a “signifying relationship of power.”

“It is not sexuality which haunts society, but society which haunts the body’s sexuality.”

I see a recent emergence of a pro-natalist social movement in Western countries related to declining fertility and the growing dominance of liberal feminist conceptions of femininity and the role of the woman as homemaker and child-bearer. Are social attitudes regarding gender cyclical in nature? What does the promise of possible technological release from the “trap of reproduction” mean for gender in modern histories and gender in society? Are we entering an era of post-feminist thought regarding the rise of transgender and asexual histories or is this tradition firmly rooted in feminism?
