# Reflections on Scott, Gender Histories 

The bulk of this article is an examination of various historian’s attempts to define or use gender in their work and Scott’s notes on the virtues and pitfalls of their approaches. To start with, Scott notes how the use of **the term “gender” itself has acted like something of a shield**, allowing the field of women’s history to grow while inculcating it from the harsh eye of less enlightened academics. *But Scott notes how this use of gender as nothing more than a synonym for “women” is ultimately faulty because it cements further the biological determinist argument that draws a causal link between gender and “sex roles,” whereas *Scott invites readers to consider that gender, while certainly related to sex, is much more of a social construction than biological differentiation.* Skipping ahead a bit, I was interested in Scott’s overview of the **materialist origin of gender**, as proposed by various Marxist historians. The argument goes that gender arises from the use of women as an economic tool for reproduction, which leads to the stratification of economic power as one group (men) effectively use the other (women) as pawns for economic benefit. *While this touches on a link between capitalism and patriarchy I’m inclined to agree does exist and still persists to this day, I also concur with Scott’s argument that such an approach boxes in the concept of gender as a strictly economic phenomenon, when in reality this is just one result of the larger social construction of gender.* 

Scott goes on to dissect some psychoanalytic theories of gender, broadly focusing on poststructuralist and object-relations theories (we’re _really_ getting academic now). I tend to agree with Scott’s assessment that **object-relations theory**, which posits that gender is constructed primarily through influence with one’s direct environment, especially their parents, is just a bit too short sighted. *While family structures certainly do impact gender norms and expectations, I do not consider individual family units as the originator of these practices, only a part of the social machinery that perpetuates them.* As for Scott’s critique of the **poststructuralist definition of gender**, which centers mainly on the influence of language and symbolic order on the formation of gender identity, I am less convinced. I can see how focusing on the individual as the origin of gender construction is limiting, so I’m not necessarily disagreeing with Scott’s argument, but *I’d contend that cloaking individuals in the language (and therefore symbolism) of masculinity or femininity is a large part of how society constructs gender on a wider scale.*

The crux of Scott’s critique of these previously proposed theories and descriptions of gender is that *they all fail to provide a meaningful explanation as to how social and political organization are formed, at least in part, by the gendering of individual members of society and the social expectations subsequently thrust upon those individuals.* Instead, each of these previous theories of gender attempt in some way to construct a universal origin for gender, reconstitute the binary antagonism of traditional conceptions of gender relations, or simply utilize gender itself as a vehicle for academic legitimacy. Seeing as none of these truly _advance_ the study of gender and its ramifications on history, Scott argues that, going forward, _historians ought to lean into the practice of history_ by not just recognizing female contributions to history but attempting to unearth how the construction of gender has shaped the ebb and flow of history itself. In simpler terms, ***Scott wishes for gender to be used as a kind of historical lens through which we can examine the course of history.***

Scott’s call to action here suggests major changes, not just in the content and methods of historical writing, but also in conceptualizations of gender as a whole. It goes without saying that women’s history has long been neglected in historical writing, a concern which Scott shares. The focus of the article, however, is much more about _the construction of gender and how gender itself can be viewed as a driving force in historical development_ – and therein lies what I consider to be the true virtue of Scott’s work. In arguing that gender be used as a historical lens through which to view the past, Scott is implicitly advocating that we must question our current social and political construction of gender, as that current understanding has been the basis for the past theories of gender which she critiques for a number of reasons. In other words, ***by investigating how and why past societies structured gender roles in the way they did, and subsequently examining the consequences of those gender constructions, historians can offer us both a more holistic view of the past and a model for unearthing the logic and utility (or lack thereof) behind contemporary constructions of gender.*** 

I believe it’s worth noting that this process of investigating how social categories like gender or race have historically been constructed and the ramifications of doing so on society carries over from our readings on **postmodernism**. For one, the notion of historical fragmentation comes to mind when one considers how feminist historians have focused their sights on the often-unappreciated work, accomplishments, and contributions of women throughout history. However, keeping in mind that Scott seems at least somewhat critical of these historians and instead opts to devote her attention to the much broader notion of gender construction itself, her work touches on a more interesting aspect of postmodern historiography – **the interplay between power and social categorization**. Scott actually mentions Foucault’s theory of power when discussing her definition of gender; Foucault held that _power is dispersed through a number of uneven relationships throughout society, be that worker and owner or man and woman._ I think we’d do well to remind ourselves going forward that ***each of the new(er) lenses of historical analysis we study, whether it’s gender, postcolonial, or so on, are rooted in the postmodern approach to history - an approach which affirms the importance of social categorization as a method of subverting, maintaining, or (in our case) explaining the relationship between the powerful and the powerless.***

Questions: 
_Do you believe gender has become a more respected or more commonly used lens of historical analysis since Scott wrote this article?_

_What has using gender as a lens for historical analysis yielded for our understanding of gender as it stands today? In other words, do we understand gender differently today as a result of investigating how gender was constructed in the past?_
