This article, or a better description, of this Historical  essay and it is  actually much more interesting and nuanced. Sure it adds an importance to women history but it adds how it was different from what people see.  This is about the study of history of men and women throughout history. This article says that it was not new the study of women was not new, says the author, Joan w. Scott. I like how she adds this because it shows how history was studied throughout the times in history.  
The suter adds that Marx's theory  was about class not about race or gender. She also adds that most historians write history in a “ descriptive and causal”. The Term `` Gender” was placed instead of women. The Author adds this because it shows that men still wrote about women in history. There are also Marx's that were feminstbut they were writing on a wide-range of topics that help out the study of history. This auteur also adds that the new left  was very important that helped out this history.
