### Gender History
Joan Scott has two underlining arguments in her article. One of the augments she brought up was the way theories can limit you on your writing. She is not stating that theories are inherently bad but that you have to analyze the theory and realize the limitation of thinking in such a way. That if you the theory is beneficial to use that it might also leave you not really talking about what you were trying to talk about. As an example, the Marxist what of talking about women that it explains why the system works but not how the system works. Another example is Joan Scott belief that object- relations theory does not leave historians a way to connect the concept to the other social systems. 

The next argument that Joan Scott brought up was the use of vocabulary and the definition that we assign to the word. That words can change definitions and that you have to define what you as the author definition of the word is. Like in the article the word “gender” has many different definitions from the definitions given in the 1800s to how the feminist used the word to mean the relationship between the sexes. And when a word does not have an agreed upon definition you have to be extremely precise in how we give our definition. Like the fact that “gender has been used as a synonym for women to make the wording seem neutral in meaning. That the writing will be more acceptable in the field because it removes some obvious bias that the word “women” has. 
This is why Joan Scott definition for “gender” that “gender is a constitutive element of social relationships based on perceived differences between the sexes, and gender is a primary way of signifying relationships of power.” This definition is very specific but also allows it to be explored and expanded upon, like how Karl Marx’s definition of class has. 

For history both of these points are significant because in terms of using theories it allows a historian to critically examine his work and be able to see where objections from his peers can come from and also the limits that the writer can say with in the context of the theory. Being mindful of wording and the definition given to a word can deepen the questions asked about the word and how it works with other systems.

Can limiting yourself to a theory limit the way you respond to history?

Can defining a word help explain your prospective on your viewpoint that you are talking about?
