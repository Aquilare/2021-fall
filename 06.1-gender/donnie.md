# Gender Power
## _connecting the dots between gender and power_

The balance of power in both historically public and painfully private moments has been vieved through the social constructs of sexual identity.  A yin yang balance of energy sought by those involved to explain and understand roles as defined by male or female. Society has placed upon humans a role based on the outward, or more accurate inward, function of the body. This leaves out emotional and in its place power and authority govern the daily balance of role and power. 

Joan Scott in her analysis of gender roles in history seems to be writing about womenâ€™s role in history as defined by a term, however, upon deeper thought given to the work it seems she is trying to seek a reason for the inequality of power. Perhaps even a question of why power must be a thing. Equality in life and reflection in history should not be based on sexual identity roles. A more cohesive and balanced approach to historical views with less categorization seems to be at the heart of this writing. 

The way we reflect upon history through the roles of male and female could be stripped away to give everyone in the account credit for what they did non respective of how they were defined based on a reproductive role. This could result in a shifting perspective to rebalance power. Equality in power balance could change society in day-to-day operations. No longer would power be distributed based on outward identity but on inward ability that expresses itself as it will outwardly. Meaning people can do as they are given the ability to as such, not rise to a predetermined identity. 

As society moves away from simplistic definitions of gender identity, will this be the foundation of true power balances in day-to-day life, or will it be used only to further categorize individuals being studied from a historical point of view?

- Could a society undefined by gender roles form a foundation of equality in day-to-day life, or will it be used only as a tool for future historians to overlook individual contributions? 
- Can we go back over the stories of the past and pull out a new, non-gender related, historiography?
