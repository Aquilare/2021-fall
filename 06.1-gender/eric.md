Joan Scott is trying to emphasize that although women have been largely ignored or related to have little to no relevance to history, that is not entirely the main issue when it comes to examining history. Scott wants us to rethink what the actual definitions of sex and gender are.

Scott highlights that we, as most western societies do, associate and define gender mostly with women. Anytime the subject is brought up into conversation we are automatically talking about women, and it can indicate a less than. 

I appreciated when Scott spoke about power dynamics because historically when gender is brought up, it is to talk about how women had less power, even when it came to women having monarchical rule. Another interesting dynamic she pointed out is that we use gender, in a sense, to punish women. She points to Iran and Nazi Germany to illustrate that these governments built policies to in essence punish women for no real reason other than they could and/or because they had/have backwards ideas about “traditional gender roles”.

Language is one of the most ingrained versions of automatic gender roles. It is hard to get away or change these gendered languages which is why I believe history is written in a certain way. Most things are going to subconsciously be written in a manner that is going to be biased towards one gender.

I am having a hard time fully comprehending what exactly she wants historians to do as a whole. I understand wanting parity with histories that focus on women and their significant roles they played but a whole redefinition of gender and how to write and study about it is where I am getting a little lost. I cannot quite tell if on top of bringing women to the forefront, must we rewrite all of history with this new lens? I imagine the answer is yes but getting that to catch or ingrained into the whole of historical writing and understanding is quite the uphill battle.

How can we move past using gender as a veiled reference to women?

Can we change language to be more gender neutral?
