# The Meaning of Gender  

In Joan Scott’s Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis there is an interesting point about linguistic developments in history and how it is relevant in the progress and evolution of studies in social, political, and cultural areas of history.  

Scott argues that the word gender being fixed as a classification and distinction of the sexes, and material, structural, and social organization of that relationship does not explain gender knowledge. Scott explains that in this context, *"although gender in this usage asserts that relationships between the sexes are social, it says nothing about why these relationships are constructed as they are, how they work, or how they change”(Scott, 1057)*. The meaning of the word must both account for historical change and the contending nature of controls that create importance of gender itself. 

Scott argues that the process of constructing gender relations can be used to discuss race, class, and ethnicity, and social interactions. This is because, as she disputes, language creates reality and influences how people think about the world and history.  

Scott's analysis of linguistics of gender, expanded on phonology, syntax, semantics, morphology, and phonetics, across different races, cultures, ethnicities, and their social interactions and provides that by changing the meaning of the word is *“to disrupt the notion of fixity, is to discover the nature of the debate or repression that leads to the appearance of timeless permanence” (Scotts, 1058)*. 

Overall, Scott’s analysis of the linguistics of gender provides that the study of linguistics is necessary to understand how people (both men and women) interacted with each other and institutions in different societies over time, and this provides historical evidence of growth and progress across diverse cultures, races, and ethnicities, opening the history to being more universal.
