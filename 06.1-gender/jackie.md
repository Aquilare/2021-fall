## History and Gender

After reading Joan Scott's *Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis*, I can see why this work was so popular and transformative during its time, and why it has continued to be so. I found her work to be both informative and engaging, despite certain concepts and ideas to be a bit difficult to fully grasp (although that has been a theme with this class across the board, though not in a bad way). 

Scott's anaylisis of the advancement of gender studies in history across a variety of works was well done, but what really made this work interesting was not only her conclusions of those analyses, finding them important, but far too focused on gender and sex **together** as a way to understand histories, instead of as their own **separate** and equally important viewpoints. 

Scott explains that for a long time the word *gender* was synonymous with *woman*, often causing confusion or misnomers to become standard, and causing "typical" gender role stereotypes to be perpetuated. 

Scott argues that if historians are going to be using *gender* as a way to study history, which they should, in order to achieve understanding of the complexities of the past, gender should also be viewed as a complex and non-binary as a whole. 
>"We need a refusal of the fixed and permanent quality of the binary opposition, a genuine historicization and deconstruction of the terms of sexual difference."

Scott's writing absolutely advocates for womens histories to become more valued, but more than that she advocates that gender as a whole be viewed from a feministic angle, both in modern times and in the past, incorporating race and class as well as sex and gender. Additionally, Scott argues that by looking at history in this way, a more vivid picture of the past can emerge. 

Viewing the past from a modern historical perspective could be seen as a paradox. Like we saw with Enlightenment thinkers, bringing your understandings of your own time and relating to that of the past can cause some unfortunate conclusions which may only perpetuate euro-centric or patriarchal ideals. However, gender history is something that could potentially benefit from this way of historical thinking an analysis. 

A few questions:
1. Do you think that a modern concepts of gender can have a beneficial impact on understanding past histories?
2. Scott argues that gender is much more than just a persons sex, but also their class and race. Do you agree?
