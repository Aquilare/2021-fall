The biggest challenge to public history is the ability to define what exactly it is. Public history is not exactly a field only historians and it is not just for archivists or museum curators either. Even after reading the article, I am little confused on how public history is its own field because it seems to be similar to science communication, which Cauvin points out.

I see the need for public history because it helps develop what communities and audiences want to preserve and see for themselves in contemporary times but as a field on its own, I am not sure it should be a whole other field. Public history should be actually be a cross section or just completely fall under the field of communications because it seems that one does not have to be an expert in a single subject or time period to be able to present it to the public.

International public history is harder to do because not everyone is going to agree on how to best do it. This is a relatively new field which means there have not been established practices that can translate across borders. 

Every country has a certain way of conducting academics and when it comes to presenting them to the public, they have to tailor it to their audiences. Someone in France is not going to want to remember/view WWII the same way as someone from the US.

The right voice to present is an almost impossible task because not everyone is going to be pleased with the final product. Most of the time when a majority is pleased with the final product, there is a loud minority of people that are going to trash it, so it seems like there is less consensus then there really is.

This may sound like a cop out, but I still believe in academics as the solution to figuring out whose voice should be heard. They may not always get it right but academics do the work to become the experts in their field so they will have a better understanding on who and what to put out to the public but there should be a note as to why.

Is there a Neil deGrasse Tyson of the history world?

Why are public historians so reluctant to work with governments when much of their funding likely comes from the government (which is the public)?
