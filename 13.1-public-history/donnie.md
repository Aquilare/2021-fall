# Public Historian, and New Media
## _The role and responsiblilty of a public historian_



In reflecting upon the job of a public historian, the image from Thomas Cauvin of historians working as missionaries to bring history to the masses is a unique and plausible description of the job. And like many of the past missionary trips, these are filled with tension, and often conflicting reports of success. 

New forms of media bring with it new audiences. Those who will be interested in historically themed messages will likely gravitate to the more creditable sources, but some might be dupped into believing stories that have not been properly researched. Good presentation and delivery can mask ill researched or one-sided opinions with little questions arising. Public historians have a responsibility to therefore, to make use of all new forms of media and bring well researched and balanced storied being told. 

If someone could turn archival research into a murder mystery podcast, the public might gain interest into research and become a more intelligently balanced culture. Reaching this influence on such a level will require imaginative presentation of quality information. 

Either way, conflict will always be a part of the process of discerning the past. New audiences will bring new arguments along with the much-needed new points of view. This should then become a more informed conversation to be productive and truly advance the study of history as a useful and helpful discipline. Otherwise, man will still get their historical information from sources that are at times off balance. Worse yet, they will argue these unresearched opinions at holiday parties for years to come. 


- What are some new approaches to history storytelling that would be interesting and factual for audiences?
- In the analogy of the tree, will the opinionated leaves fall to the ground, turn to compost, and then totally alter the soil of history for even greater misinterpretation or clarification?
