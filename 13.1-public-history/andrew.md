# Reflection on Cauvin, Public History 

Possibly the greatest challenge to doing public history is determining what the field is actually comprised of, or put more simply, what the term public history refers to. Even after reading this article, I – as someone with very little knowledge of public history – am still struggling a bit to determine what precisely one means when they say they study public history. I do think that Cauvin’s metaphor of the tree helps in conceptualizing the field of public history, but nevertheless the definitions we’re given (or the purposeful lack of an exact definition) all remain so broad it makes the practice of public history rather difficult.  

In any field of history, but especially public history, I think it is imperative that readers (or consumers of history more broadly) have access to multiple accounts and interpretations of the same historical phenomena, and thus I believe that the more actors involved in the creation or discussion of historical narratives, the more our historical understanding grows – provided that said actors adhere to a shared set of literary standards when composing their histories, and that they are willing to engage in a discourse with those who challenge their work.

Given this, an international public history is desirable for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the chance for readers to understand historical events and their significance through the lens of other nations and people within those nations. If nothing else, this provides an escape route out of the often jingoistic nationalism our early history lessons are soaked in. But more than that, I believe that including historians from across the world in the kind of collaborative discourse Cauvin advocates for is vital for expanding our understanding of history. This is because these historians are likely to be operating within different paradigms (as we learned about in our Fulbrook readings), and thus in fostering a discourse and finding the commonalities between distinct interpretations of the past, we all can learn something. 

However, I think it’s worth noting the significant challenge to international public history that Cauvin brings up, that being differences in language communities (another aspect of history that Fulbrook talked about). Cauvin notes how some nations have starkly different understandings of what public history means. For instance, the French typically associated “public” with matters of government and policy, which doesn’t come close to encapsulating the meaning of “public” as the NCPH in America employs it. Interestingly, Cauvin mentions how the Italian Association of Public History elected to keep the English version of “public history” both because they wanted to be involved in the international discourse and because the Italian translation would have more closely resembled ‘controversies of the past’ rather than what is typically meant by public history. This speaks to the idea of creating a lingua franca with which all international parties could use to communicate, though doing is dangerous as it runs the risk of legitimizing the authority and interpretations of the nation from which the lingua franca is chosen (most likely American and most likely English). 

All the more reason, then, why both Fulbrook and Cauvin encourage a collaborative discourse in which historians can engage with one another’s work, even if they operate within different paradigms, in an effort to grow their historical understanding. In the context of public history, I think this discourse is even more important given that many of the actors within public history are not strictly academics, but lower-level educators, hobbyists, and lay members of the public. If there is any field in which to embrace discourse and eschew authoritative metanarratives, it’s that of public history. 

Questions: 
_1 - Does the collabortive approach to public history that Cauvin advocades for disempower academic historians?_

_2 - Was there anything about the development of Public History (as Cauvin briefly describes in Section 4) that surprised you?_
