I would say that the first and largest issue with forming public history is the need to define it. With the definitions that public history is: 

1)“a field in the historical sciences made up of professionals who undertake historical work in a variety of public and private settings for different kinds of audiences worldwide.” 

 

2)“a movement, methodology, and approach that promotes the collaborative study and practice of history; its practitioners embrace a mission to make their special insights accessible and useful to the public.” 

 

The author believes that there is no need to define public history as he doesn’t believe it is truly possible. I firmly fall into the camp that if you can’t define the purpose of a movement or way of viewing history it would be extremely difficult to organize as many simply couldn’t identify with it simply because they don’t know what it is. Furthermore, the nature of international public history to involve the viewpoints of many different nations, cultures, and religions. Obviously, this closeness of differing viewpoints will lead to differences in many views. I would think that some of these have the possibility to come into direct conflict with one another on topics such as wars. 

 

I would argue that while public history is desirable and has arguably already happened. This viewpoint was mentioned in the article but I really didn’t see a valid response to it. The only differentiation between public history and “academic history” is that you need the following set of skills in order to properly perform public history: “Designing exhibitions, making audiovisual productions and compiling and managing archives and collections are, for instance, some of the skills that need to be learned to practice public history.” I really don’t see any certain quality of public history that would differentiate it from something like the History channel. The article also mentions the argument that public history is merely adding a larger branch of communication to history; again, I can't quite see how this is different from things like the history channel (if the history channel isn’t public history). For the most part I would think that the main point of public history is to do a better job of communicating and expanding/protecting the current sources and understandings of history. 

 

Of course, it also involves utilizing different paradigms and viewpoints from different cultures and compiling these different histories. This can of course be valuable as it varies the inputs of different historians and thus allow us to view many different histories and thus get us closer to the “limit of history.” 

 

1) Can public history be call “history” in the normal sense? 

2) In what ways is public history different from regular hisotry?
