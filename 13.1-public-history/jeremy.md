What are the tensions and challenges of doing public history?

Some of the tensions and challenges of doing public history are the tensions that are created between the historian and the other actors that are disseminating information to the public. There is always a worry with Historians that the information getting out to the masses is sound and has gone through vigorous academic research and that there is proper training for the actors who are going about producing public history to the public at large. 

Is international public history either desirable or possible?

The issue of public history being an international was a large focus throughout the article and we see in the article how difficult a task it is to make public history something universal worldwide. We saw in the article that there was a lot of disagreements on definitions for public history and what it should be called universally. “There is therefore a definite ambiguity about whether or not we should define public history. I personally do not think it is necessary or even possible to provide a strict one size fits all definition of the field that encompasses the multiple international approaches. However, I do think it is necessary to create spaces to discuss what public history can be and how it relates to local, national, and thematic practices and theories of History.” (Cauvin, 20) We see from the author of the piece that it’s very hard to be able to agree on just a definition of international public history because language can be a barrier that can be misinterpreted very easily and ideas can be misunderstood by a different international audience. 

It’s easy to see how Fulbrook’s advice may useful for public history practitioners, but what are the challenges of implementing what she’s arguing in public history contexts? What are potential solutions?

When you are thinking of applying Fullbrooks advice it seems that it could be quite challenging because in the Cauvin piece public history by its very nature is set p for mass consumption of information and there isn’t much room for nuance. “Actors” who are doing public history are not aware of Fulbrooks paradigms and frameworks because these concepts are meant to be used and interpreted by professional historians not necessarily by members of the general public. I think a potential solution that Cauvin kind of suggested at the end of the piece was that maybe we could  have historians explain or make these concepts aware to “actors” who are doing public history maybe have historians in a supervisory role to make sure they are able to question and access what is being produced by the “actors” creating public history. 

Questions 

As technology and social media are taking larger and more influential places in society and that it where Public History is being created and consumed will institutions that create professional Historians need to change the way they communicate? Will communication be an essential skill in the discipline of becoming a professional Historian?

Is it better for Public History to remain kind of undefined or abstract when we think about It in international terms? 

It seems that Public History operates on a consumeristic/capitalistic model where the product produced must be sold to the public. Is this potentially a reason why professional Historians may be reluctant to embracing Public History? Is it better not focus on the marketability of history and more on the raw substance?
