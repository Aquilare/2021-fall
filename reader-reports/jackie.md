# Sadie - Maximilian Karl Emil Weber

### First Paragraph
- I think there should be a full stop after 'research' in the first sentence. The entire paragraph at the moment is just one sentance and it's a bit awkward.
- The quote includes a lot of jargon right off the bat. If possible, break it down into simpler terms and in your own words. I don't think that the full quote is necessary here.  

### Second Paragraph
- The second paragraph begins with a quotation mark, but it is unclear what the quote is. This sentence/paragraph is also exceedingly long which makes it confusing. Break it up into easier to read and understand pieces. 
- The last chunk of the second paragraph, "**Weber sought to separate academic analysis from political prescriptions, with his notion of value neutral and objectivity**" would make a good first sentence of this section. Then, explain what those notions were. 

### Third Paragraph
- un-bold "and the" between the two titles. It makes it look as if it is one long book title. 
- full stop after 'conducts of history.' Then start the next sentance with something like "these ideals resulted in..."
- there is a funky quotation here. I can't tell where the quote begins. 
- The final sentence seems a bit off and seems as if it could be included in the previous sentence as to what his resulting ideologies were. 

### Fourth Paragraph
- explain what anit-positivism, origins of rationalization, secularization, and disenchantment are.  
- This paragraph and the citations are very confusing. Maybe go through each of Webers topics one by one, explain what they are and how Weber felt about them individually. Make sure your quotations are concise in explaining how they fit to Webers topics. 

### Interpretations of the Conduct of History
- Break up the first sentence into two. Full stop after 'national liberal party.' Also explain what a huguenot and an absolutist is. Why did these things lead to his obsession of historical interpretation?
- While the quote at the end of the first paragraph is informational, try rephrasing it into your own words. Also, if it is relevant to the rest of the essay, include why his work caused tension, or remove it. 
- Having stand alone quotes as single paragraphs are confusing. Try to link them other sentences which can support them and provide context. 
- I don't understand the reference to England 1560-1640, Wurttemberg 1680-1780, and Prussia 1690-1740. There is a lot of jargon included in this section. 
- It seems to me that the first and final paragraphs of this section go together a bit better, but that the middle sections are misplaced. I feel like you could include the first and last paragraph in an introductory section at the beginning of the essay. This way Weber and his background, as well as the political and social climate of the time is introduced before Weber's intellectual resposnses to them. 

### The Protestant Eithic and the Spirit of Capitalism
- make sure the titles of works are italicized or bolded. Be consistent throughout your paper. 
- There are quite a few run on sentences which unfortunately makes this difficult to follow. Break up your ideas here. Additionally, you could break this section into multiple paragraphs. 

### Charisma
- I'm not sure that you need to include everything about the legal-rationality, etc. I think that you can briefly bring it in to your discussion on charisma, but your focus should be on charisma itself and why it is important to Weber's argument. 
- There seems to be two sentences within the second paragraph that are almost identical. I think if you cut the first sentence the rest will flow a bit better. 
- The in text citation for Economy and Society should be (Weber, page number). Since there are multiple Weber works discussed, it would then be (Weber, year, page number).

### Ideal Types
- Include more information about who Emil Durkheim is if you're going mention his name and ideals. At least his first name and when he lived. 
- Providing examples of each ideal type would be helpful. The theoretical description is detailed, but the context isn't there for an introductory reader to understand what that means. 
- Break up the sentence between the Shills & Finch and LÃ¶wy quotes, its a bit clunky.

I think that you have a really interesting and solid base for your paper, and the amount of research and information you have included is really impressive. There are some formatting and editing issues that made your paper confusing to read in some spots, such as the random or unclosed quotation marks. There was also a lot of jargon and highly specific terms and concepts which were never fully explained, and could prove problematic for an introductory reader. It's so hard to narrow things down when a person was so influential, but I think that if you were to explicitly describe one or even two of Webers most influential concepts like his thoughts on Charisma or Ideal Types, it would be easier for readers to fully grasp that one concept.  
That being said, great work! You really have done a lot of work and you should be proud of it! I'm looking forward to reading your final paper :)

# Red - The Great War 

### Introduction
- I like the content of the introduction but I think the delivery could be refined a bit. "Tales of the World Wars, particulary those of WWI, have been of interest to historians since the events themselves, and because of this there are many variations of the same story" or something like that? 
- A few grammatical fixes needed here, "passed" instead of pasted for instance.
- Don't pose a question about WWII if you won't be discussing it in your paper. Otherwise, this is an interesting concept. 
- Isolationism doesn't need to be capitalized. 

### National Perspectives
- This first sentence is a great analogy! If you switch up the phrasing just a bit, to "the oceans and the lands that were fought on" it flows just a bit better and makes the picture more vivid. 
- How is blame a gamble? 
- Explain what treaty it is that you're referencing.
- Include a bit more information about the primary and secondary roles that Germany and the Austro-Hungarians played during this time. What makes these roles confusing?
- Why is their motive a given? 

### Political and Social Perspectives
- Whose, or what actions are up in the air in regards to rationality?
- The first paragraph needs some clarifications. Go into more detail about the measures that were or were not reached, etc. 
- The last sentence of the first paragraph is a bit confusing, and could be split into multiple ideas and clarified just a bit. I see where you're going and I like it, its just not quite there yet. 
- Great quote selection. It really works with what you're trying to say here. 

### Propaganda
- This sentence is very true, but there is so much more you can write here! 

### Conclusion 
- You mention that the Great War was bloody and that it acted as a catalyst to WWII. Will you expand upon that more in the body of your essay? 
- Including information about the historiography's checkered past is great, but go into more detail about why it is checkerd. 

Nice work, Red! I think you have a really interesting idea and some good foundational information for your essay, and I look forward to your final draft. Make sure you explictly describe the things you are talking about, such as WWI being known as the Great War, who was involved, and what years it occurred. If you can, touch on some of the most important aspects of the Great War from a historical and historiographical perspective, including specifics (like you did with the Treaty of Versaille, except in even more detail).
