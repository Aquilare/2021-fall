- 	The Lincoln photo looks like there are extra spaces between history and there are some odd spacing in the first picture as well. 
-	Is there a need for the (nonexistent historical) with you already have stated that they are fictional?
-	The first sentence of simplifying history feels like it should follow the second sentence
-	The Quote of Bruno Ramirez might look better as a stand-alone quote. 
-	Filmmakers as the Occasional historian I feel like you did not explain Quentin Tarantino’s film and the historical context that it had correctly used. You only stated that it spoke as a contemporary era of our time.
-	The last sentence is confusing in Filmmakers as the Occasional Historian.
-	“They understood that when it comes to the relationship between filmmaking and the role of the historian, telling the “truth” was going to be subjective as it pertained to what medium (public television, mass media consumption as major film releases, independent documentaries, etc.) was presenting that history.” This sentence is messy with the parenthesis 
-	The last sentence in Historiographical Narrative and Agency would read better as a statement rather than a question.
-	“And although it can be argued that what filmmakers present for historiography is a form of public history.” What does this sentence do? It does not flow with what was stated before it. It feels like it was supposed to be part of the second paragraph. 
-	“but the movie is still nice to watch.” I feel like it needs to be reworded. 
-	Another thing to remember is citing (Author, page number).

Overall, the paper read well though it was on the short side. I would have liked to see more about Django Unchained and its historical accuracy. Another thing is that the last two topics seemed to be very similar to each other. One of the things I did notice is that your voice of disdain for “Historical” movies comes clearly out. I feel that you never answer or suggest any way to solve that responsibility or show an example of the other side of the augment where even missing voices and a water-downed version did show a narrative that was as close as one could get with telling the history of the event.

-	You need to add your name to the paper
-	Add some photos
-	Make some other sections other than one long one
-	Forgot to do the bibliography and the normal citations and not the annotated bibliography 
-	Last sentence “Present”, not presents 
-	Second paragraph does not need to be there
-	Some of the paragraphs are not spaced like the others and feel like they are part of the paragraph before it. 
-	What is a meta historian? 
-	“Historian Alun Munslow explores the academic approaches to history that have developed over the years. Included in this book is his thoughts on Narrative portals of history.” This sentence lost me and felt like it was ripped right out of your annotated bibliography and is a harsh break from what was before it.
-	Remember to cite like (Author, 1). not (Author, p1)
-	“It is likely an impossible endeavor, although at times valiantly fought, the attempt at being neutral to a degree of leaving oneself at the edge of the historical event being told, However, the truth of the matter in this instance is the near impossibility of the academic bring their own life’s understanding to a subject” is a run-on sentence and is confusing. 
-For me it was very diffuclt to read

Overall, you had all the ideas, and I can see where the path you were going down was. First thing is that it needs some headings for the subsections, remember this is not really an essay per say. One of the things that you do that breaks the flow of the paper is that you put the author and the book they wrote and an overview of the book, which really does not need to be there because if the reader wants to know about the book, they will look at the bibliography and read it. There feels like there is no end and the last paragraph feels like there is more to come but it does not. The paper feels like you looked at one source wrote about what that one source was talking about and then jumped to your next source and repeated the process.
