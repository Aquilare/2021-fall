*Byzantine Historiography*

-Abstract - A genre of medieval Greek literature – can you clarify this statement?  I am confused on if this essay is about literature or historical writing.  The word “history” a few times, not sure if you could use a different word later on. You could break up the last sentence for more clarity.

-Procopian - The first sentence is a little awkward. I know you mentioned you needed to insert citations into your paragraphs.  The paragraph on Agathias ends in a confusing way.  Maybe you could talk about Evagrius and his work a little bit more so your reader knows why he is important.

-10th Century- Something went wrong with the heading and image codes, so I could not give feedback on images and captions.  Maybe reconsider using the word “discuss” and “discussed” in the same paragraph.  

-Comnenian/Polaiologan Era – The opening paragraph is great! Don’t forget to add a space between the parens in the second sentence.
2nd para- Maybe mention who Anna Comnena’s father is again just for clarity.
3rd para – The paragraph ending is a little confusing.
4th para – The opening sentence talks about John Cinnamus, but then the paragraph goes back to discussing Anna Comnena.  If Cinnamus is a supplement to Anna’s work, you might mention it right away.  The last sentence is a bit confusing and long.
5th para- You might want to break up the second sentence.  
6th para- You might want to break up the second sentence.  Why was the writing of Akropolites important?  What did he write about?  Maybe revise the last sentence as little more so it’s not similar to the one that ends the 3rd para.
7th para – You might want to break up the second sentence.  It seems like the quote from Laurent is missing a word.  Maybe discuss the last sentence of the paragraph a bit more.
8th para- Talk more about what Kantakouzenos wrote about so your reader knows why he is important.

-Conclusion – This paragraph might fit better if it’s incorporated into the opening.  The abstract mentions that Byzantine historiography affected history writing more generally, but the essay doesn’t go into this topic and that would be really interesting to tie into the overall narrative.

-Biblio- You might need to check that italics are used in proper names of books and journals you've cited. I’m not sure if using reviews is alright or not, maybe Dr. Gibbs can clarify that.  Be sure that your author names aren’t in all caps.

This essay is good!  There are a lot of names and information, but maybe include more info on what exactly each Byzantine historian felt was important to write about in terms of historical events.  Also, maybe go into more detail about the actual writings and leave out some of the quotes from people who wrote sources you consulted.  Overall, the paragraphs are well connected, and the narrative thread does a great job of following a chronological sequence which made sense.  Great job Michael!

*Historiography of the Third Reich*

-Abstract – to be added later

-Weimar Historiography – Is this beginning paragraph really more of an abstract?  The first few sentences seem like it, but then I can see why you labeled this as Weimar Historiography.
2nd para – As we discussed in class, move the last sentence and make it the first one in this paragraph.  That would make it a great segue into the issues surrounding German professors and the Nazi regime.
3rd para – Is there a way to identify what the National Socialist movement was?

-A Bitter Defeat – Well written!  Great map with caption too.

-*Volkische* History – maybe make ‘volkstum’ bold as well as (people’s character).

-Conservative-Nationalist “Objectivity” – add the word “with” before Weber in the second sentence.

-Objectivity Versus Impartiality – First sentence is off with the “more and more” phrasing.  Maybe rephrase and say something like “, which required more and more technical training.”  Maybe make the term positivism bold since it is defined within the sentence.
3rd para – First sentence could be more concise if you removed the word “being.”

-Historiography Under the Nazi – Add a comma after Weimar Republic in the first sentence.

-The “Nazi School” of History – First sentence is very long, is there a way to break it up?

-“Obliterate the Traces” – Second paragraph, The Nazis’ references to history mean only – I think “mean” is supposed to be “meant.”  The third paragraph is a bit long, and I think you could divide it into two and it would still flow well.

-Tacit Resistance – This is a great section with a powerful caption and photo.

-Post-War Nazi Influences – really great final paragraph.  The conclusion is a bit short, but it wraps things up well enough.

-Biblio- Darhendorf citation needs a comma before the year at the end, remove the period.  The Schönwälder citation has an extra asterisk before the title of the journal.

Wow, Michael!  This was a beautifully written essay that flowed well and followed a great chronological narrative.  I think your captions and photos were excellent and the only things I felt needed to be looked over again were minor.  I would maybe break up the first section into more of an abstract and then go into the Weimar Republic detail.  Really well done.
