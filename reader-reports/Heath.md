__Early Soviet Union Historiography by Eric__ 
In the sentence: “Leon Trotsky was a leading Russian revolutionary and not a trained historian, but he had great contributions to the study of Soviet history.” I think the back half of the sentence could be deleted or reworked into another sentence. By having his own section I think it might be understood that he had great contributions to soviet history 

 Don’t forget to put itallics on the names of books in the sentence: “Even after falling out of favor with the Communist Party and getting deported from the USSR, Trotsky wrote some of his seminal works about the Revolution, including The History of the Russian Revolution and his autobiography My Life.” 

 

I think you forgot to finish this sentence: “History was the preeminent historical work that took into account the entire Revolution of 1917, from February to October, with a .” Also I wasn’t too sure if History in this sentence is in reference to ___The History of the Russian Revolution___ or not. 

 

This is an incredible sentence! I think you just need a semi colon in there: “His underlying purpose was to elevate his position as being the other true leader of the Revolution alongside Lenin and to call out other Soviet leaders, especially Stalin, as being unworthy of leading the Communist Party.” 

 

This sentence does a great job of describing Trotsky but I think it should be moved from the bottom of the section towards the top. I would even consider making the first paragraph of the section to only be a description of Trotsky and the other sentences about his impact. “It would be worth reiterating that Trotsky was not a trained historian. He relied on his own memory to formulate his works and the publications of the Istpar. To say that his writings were completely biased due to his sources being Communist Party approved would be an understatement. With that being said, Trotsky’s contributions to this period of Soviet historical writing were enormous.” 

 

Change the word “training” to “trainer” in this sentence: “and the training of historians.” 

 

I would be careful of using biased language in the second to last paragraph in the “The Father of Soviet Historiography” section 

 

I like the Stalin section, I would suggest just adding a few sentences on who Stalin is/give some background before going into some of his actions. 

 

Overall you have some really good stuff here in the essay. One of the biggest things I would suggest is that you put the definition of Marxism and Marxist-Leninism in the first few paragraphs of the essay. I know you defined Marxism towards the end but I don’t believe you defined Marxist-Leninism.  

I noticed that in every description of the pictures you said “the man who...” maybe try differentiating some of the descriptions of the various men. 

 

In the sentence “A main criticism Stalin had was the way previous histories had been written, especially the way they were framed chronologically.” I suggest trying to elaborate on the problems Stalin had with the writing of previous histories. What in characteristic did Stalin not like about the History? 

 

Good work man I can tell it’s going to come together really well! 

 

__Medieval Russian and Tsarist Historiography by Christopher__ 

 

You absolutely nailed that establsihing paragraph 

 

Don’t forget to put italics on book titles 

 

The “The Tale of Bygone Years” section is incredible. I think you might’ve written a little too close to the history side of the “history vs historiography” discussion. I think you can leave everything you have now but maybe add a little bit more historiographical elements to the end of paragraphs.  

 

I think it’s the same thing in the “Chronicle Editions of the North and South” section. You’ve written incredibly interesting establishing sentences I think you just need to execute with adding in some more historiographical elements. 

 

This essay is absolutely incredible it really does feel like reading a history article from the history channel. The only problem is that I think there needs to be a little more discussion of historiography throughout the essay. The “Ivan the terrible” section had a good amount of historiography and history mixed together really well, if you can recreate this in the other sections it’ll be perfect. 

 

I would consider adding a little bit more to the descriptions of your photos. Maybe their significance or a sentence about what they depict.
