•	First Paragraph; As we talked about in class, combing your last two sentences into one, and then moving that to the top of your essay would help the first paragraph define Microhistory. 

•	Second Paragraph, second sentence; try adding a word like Formed, or Developed after the word, “events” to see if this connects the two ideas in a cohesive way. 

•	Good explanation on the focus of microhistories on those that have been forgotten or overlooked in history. Every story is important, and this shows in the purpose of microhistory.  

•	Interesting look and explanation of the worm and the cheese. This approach to historical study can related to a few other approaches and intersects well with them, as you point out in this section. 

•	I like how you explain the criticism microhistory will face especially as it relates to biography and narrative styles. 

•	Microhistory in the Future: Try rearranging this first sentence with the second part coming first. Such as; It would appear that microhistory is falling out of popular favor with what seems to be a lack of connection to the larger picture of history….or something along these lines. The rest of the paragraph flows well. 

This is a very well-organized essay with good flow from subject to subject. My favorite picture is that of the map, and it’s also nice to have pictures of the people you are talking about as you have provided. 

I learned a lot about this aspect of historical study from your essay, and your future readers will too. The need to look back over history and tell the stories of people who made a difference in their world is highlighted as a strength of microhistory and is clear from your writing. 

A quick proofread after taking time away from your paper will likely correct any sentences that might be missing a word here and there.  

Nice Job, Alex!

•	Great Introduction

•	Inform then entertain; this is well written and so true. A small amount of fact is given then the film moves into a direction that would have looked unfamiliar to those who were there. 


•	The occasional historian; well said. Many people like history and want the truth. It should be easy enough to present the most accurate history in a way that is entertaining and factual. 

This is a well-organized, professional looking essay. Good pictures—in that they explain the essays topic and support the point. The captions are great. 
Elegantly written throughout with clear explanation. You know where the essay is going, and this will put your readers at ease.  Many people can relate to the frustrations of not having a true historical point of view in films. 

Great Job, Kelly!
