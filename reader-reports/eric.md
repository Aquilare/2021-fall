- First picture gives no real context, to the first section. I recommend a map of Kievan Russia to give an idea to the area being described because I got confused that it was not the whole of present day Russia and it included parts of Ukraine.
- The first sentence is kind of confusing because I do not know if a person or civilization/government are being referenced. 
- Italicize book names like The Tale of Bygone Years/Chronicle. 
- The majority of what was left by the Rus’ were vassalized by the Mongol Empire. – confusing sentence, it sounds like the Russians sacked instead of being sacked.
