- First picture gives no real context, to the first section. I recommend a map of Kievan Russia to give an idea to the area being described because I got confused that it was not the whole of present day Russia and it included parts of Ukraine.
- The first sentence is kind of confusing because I do not know if a person or civilization/government are being referenced. 
- Italicize book names like The Tale of Bygone Years/Chronicle. 
- The majority of what was left by the Rus’ were vassalized by the Mongol Empire. – confusing sentence, it sounds like the Russians sacked instead of being sacked.
- The last two paragraphs from _Chronicle Editions of the North and South_ give no details on who possibly wrote the Codex’s are, why they are important, and what are the differences between the referenced narratives.
- “Grand Prince Ivan III the Great took the Great Stand” I recommend taking out the Great or putting an AKA because it sounds confusing with the ‘III’ and then have two Great’s next to each other sounds awkward.
- I am not sure if ‘ca’ needs a period after, but I have been told, if you are going to be wrong, be wrong consistently
- Tsar of All Russias’. – Needs quotes and to be changed to Russians
- Define Autocephaly because it seems important.
- There are a lot of oddly placed the’s, ‘extending to the Caesar Augustus’
- ‘Biblical history, to classical history, Byzantine history, and Russian history’ I recommend rewording this because there are too many history’s. “from biblical times to classical era and then from Byzantine to medieval Russia.”
- Not sure what the first sentence of the last paragraph in Ivan IV the Terrible and Early Tsarist Russia is supposed to mean.

Overall, this essay was pretty interesting. I think there needs to be more about the authors of history instead of the subjects of history like the tsars. There was a lot of historical contexts that could be trimmed a little because there are too many people being referenced. In particular, the first section. I got confused right off the bat because there were a lot of tribes being referenced that do not really come back into the story. The formation of early medieval Russia to late medieval Russia is great to know but we should learn a bit more about who was writing these stories.

Not sure where to possibly fit this is but did the Mongols have any influence on how history was written in Russia? They were conquered by them so I would assume there would have to be some kind of influence there.

- A year for when “second communist congress in London” occurred would be helpful
- “The Revolutions of 1848, attempts by the Germans to overthrow their authoritarian government” – “Revolutions” would indicate multiple but only one is defined. I recommend taking out the “attempts” sentence all together.
- The first sentence in _Marxist Beliefs_ could be reworded. There is number (1) in the second paragraph which makes it seem like there is going to be a list there is only one item on the list.
- Book titles need to be italicized.
- Need page numbers for citations.
- “In the case of Marxism this end goal is the end of poverty under the capitalist system.” Comma after Marxism. Possibly “the end goal is the eradication of…”?
- “This ultimate” could be “The ultimate”
- There are some missing commas.
- Put a comma and take out “He here states”
- _ Marxism and Government_ is an enormous section. There needs to be a break somewhere. I recommend making “Problems around the writing of history…” be the break.
- Give Kautsky his years of life!
- “he did such an impressive job” should be a new sentence.
- “who did so much to popularize Marxism in the west that he earned the title “The Pope of Marxism.” Could be reworded.
- First reference to Fan Wenlan should be a new paragraph.
- There is an odd trend of some words being capitalized that do not need to be like opium, and others that should like Opium Wars.
- When referencing a person, typically just the last name should be used. Last line in the China section, you refer to Wenlan as Fan, but with others you use only use their last name like Marx.
- “1 million allied soldiers” = “one million Allied soldiers”
- The bibliography needs more formatting.

Overall, this was a very well written essay. I had a firm grasp on the narrative throughout. There could be a lot more minor details such as years of events. For example, the conclusion of the occupation of Japan should have a year for reader context. I really like the country sections, but there should definitely be a section about Lenin and/or Russia. There is a good narrative about Marxism as a whole except the first section. Engles gets written about but what was his influence on Marxism? Why isn’t it called Englism? There should also be a conclusion paragraph summing up Marxist influence on history and in the various affected countries.
