## Thematic, Narrative

### Procopian Era

- I guess I'm confused about what exactly the significance of Procopius' mysterious nature comes from. Why is his mysterious writing important? You explained it's difficult to "pin-down," but so what?
- You speak of the inclusion of Agathias into the Procopian period, how he "fits firmly." But why does he fit firmly? Is it just a time period?
- I would probably remove the sentence about historians disagreeing over the character of public figures and how this is similar to today.
- Why is Agathias important? You mention he's part of the Procopian period and "only included the work of contemporaries." Why does this matter?
- What does Agathias say about Procopius? The quote you included says that members of the Procopian group will speak approvingly *or not* of other members based on the level of erudition, but this doesn't realy tie together Procopius and Agathias. If you mentioned Agathias because he said something about Procopius, you should mentiuon what he said. If you added Agathias into the essay just because he's another historians from the period... well, I need something more. Why does he matter?
- Good explanation for the importance of Theophylact
- Religion is important so historians wrote about religion. But, so what? How did focus on ecclisiastical matters influence the doing of history in the Procopian period? Did it affect what sources they used? Did it affect notions of how history unfolds (cyclically, linerally, etc)? I think you need to say more than just this.

### 10th Century Constantinian Historiography

- Instead of leading with mentioning that there is less historiographical content to be discussed in this section and drawing attention to the essay I am reading, put the next sentence first, explaining that historical writing was sparse during the Constantinian era, but also explaining *why* if you can.
- Good paragraph on Constantine VII, maybe bold the part that mentions making learning of the past more accessible? 

### The Comnenian/Polaiologan Era

- What makes Anna Comnena's work a work of literature? Maybe say more about this work.
- The paragraph on Anna's husband Bryennius is a little strange, as it doesn't seem to have any historiographical content. I would probably merge the two paragraphs on Anna and Bryennius as one, rather than regarding Bryennius as a separate historian with his own paragraph. Example for how to combine the two paragraphs:

> Anna Comnena's most significant work is her *Alexiad*, which is an account of the reign of her father, the emperor Alexius I Comnenus. According to Byzantine historian E.R.A. Sewter, it is "one of the materpieces of Byzantine literature and history...  including her famous account of the First Crusade" (Sewter, pp). This critically-acclaimed work is widely regarded as an example of Greek literature under the genres of history as well as biography. T.C. Lounghis describes the aim of the  *Alexiad* as "to record the deeds of her father, completing a history commissioned by Anna’s mother and begun by Bryennius" (Lounghis, pp). This does not mean, however, that Bryennius’s intellectual capabilities were somehow dependent on or “piggybacking” off of those of his wife. John II Comnenus (Anna’s brother and the Byzantine emperor) felt threatened by Bryennius as he viewed “Anna and her husband as a learned and formidable couple, and Bryennius in particular as so powerful” to the point of presenting a potential threat to the Emperor's power.

- Next paragraph (on John Cinnamus) is good, nice historiographical relevance
- Ok, so you're describing the history of Byzantine history writing such that you're not really talking about the doing of history so much as what topics these historians covered. You mention here that the work of Chroniates is the single most important source for Byzantine history between 1118 and 1204. That's cool. But what did he say about it? How did he go about depicting the events therein? The essence of historiography, to me, is how historians saw their history and their place in it, and how they wrote about it, not necessarily just what time period they wrote about. You quote that's he's "insightful, sophisticated" etc. but what makes him so?
- The note about historiography of a time period affecting modern conceptions of the era is good. But did historical scholarship change between the Comnenian and Palaiologan dynasties? Or is it just a separation in time and not in historical methodologies?
- (I would probably split this section between the Comnenian and Palaiologon Dynasties)
- Mention of impartiality is good! This is the kind of thing that would be more welcome throughout this essay, as I feel a lot of the other sections are missing discussion of how these historians did history or conceived of it. Mention of impartiality here under Pachymeres is great. Maybe bold the word.
- You mention that Gregoras deals more with ecclesiastical as much as civil affairs, which is a break from "traditional" history, wheras in the Procopian era you stated that ecclesiastical matters were commonly written about. There seems to be a break between these two statements. Is it traditional to not write about ecclesiastical matters or the other way around? Maybe need to draw a connection between these two statements at the beginning and end of the essay.


## Writing, Grammar, Spelling, and Sentence Structure

### Procopian Era
- The Greek lettering is cool to see (as someone who took a semester of Greek it's fun to practice reading) but beyond that it's a little distracting. Not a huge deal, so I think stylistically it's up to you whether you keep them or not.

### The Comnenian/Polaiologan Era
- Why include "in a review of the work being added to the Penguin Classics collection"? I don't see the historiographic significance of whether the work is in the Penguin Classics collection or not. But maybe you can explain the significance I'm missing?
- "highly regarded work can be regarded" - try not to use the same word within the same sentence (or even within adjacent sentences) if you can manage it. It's very clunky.
- instead of inserting quotes from the authors you cite, try to paraphrase their points more. It's better to have direct quotes when the content is not so analytic as it is thematic or literary/metaphorical/symbolic. In other words:

> “This work is an example of the traditional school of Byzantine historial writing in that it consists of an introductory summary of earlier history and a much fuller account of events contemporary with the author. But it departs from tradition in that it deals as much, or more, with ecclesiastical as with civil affairs.”

is a quote that should be paraphrased, wheras

> "George Pachymeres, impartial as much as a Byzantine could was to be, whose honest face is almost an exception in the gallery of historians of Constantinople, has more than any of his followers suffered from the oblivion and indifference of his compatriots.”

is a quote that is literary enough to suffer from paraphrasing and does best as a block quote. "honest face", "suffered from oblivion and indifference" are good quoteable phrases. In my opinion.

-LASTLY: you probably already know but the essay as a whole needs some proofreading as there are sentences that are very awkward, words out of place, words that need italics, and so on. Also needs in-line citations.


## Final Thoughts

A good essay with a lot of interesting information. I do think you need to insert some more information about what your sources say about *how* these historians did and conceived of history in addition to mentioning that they covered such & such time period and that they're important as the only extant source from that era. Which is no doubt a reason for their importance, but is not exactly a very exciting historiographical insight.
