## Karli - Archival Theory
This is honestly an extremely well done essay. I found that it flowed through the narrative of the topic very concisely, and was very easy to understand. I had found it difficult to find many flaws, if any at all. The paragraphs are a good length, its organization is very logical, and as someone who knows next to nothing about the history of archival theory, I found that it was very accessible and informative. One extremely minor thing I did notice was that "Hilary", as in Sir Hilary Jenkinson was spelled "Hillary" in the hyperlink provided for the first paragraph of that sentence.

The first change I would personally make is the inclusion of the definition of "archive" somewhere in the beginning, befor going into the history of it. Thinking about the topic as though I know absolutely nothing about it led me to question what exactly an archive was, and as such, going into the history of archives without that explicitly made definition made the whole discussion feel somewhat incomplete to me.

One improvement I believe that could be made is to maybe  go a little more into detail about Walter Stapledon, and how he had gone about reorganizing the English royal archives. It's very nitpicky but I feel like nitpicking is the only way to get most of any useful criticism of this very well done piece of writing. Ather small improvement that could be made is the italicizing of Archivo General de Indias (being that it's in a foreign language), as it appears in the final paragraph of the "A Very Brief History of Archives" section.

Another small criticism would be the inclusion of the detail regarding the Dutch Manual having been "written during a period of significant change in the international power structures of governments and nations". As it currently stands, the inclusion of this detail in this sentence doesn't seem to me immediately relevant, and I believe that it can be included later in the paragraph when talking about how the manual was quickly being translated into other languages, as I feel that doing so would emphasize the importance of the manual and its having been translated to so many languages so rapidly.

Other than that, I find it difficult find any other issues I have with the essay, as I had said initially, it is extremely well written and would be an invaluable asset to add to the Metahistory course page.

## Michael M - Historiography of the Third Reich

Right off the bat, I would change the title. "Historiography *of* the Third Reich" sounds more to me like it is about post-war historiography about the Third Reich. Maybe change it to "Historiography *under* the Third Reich"?

This sentence in the second paragraph, "In a 1951 survey, for example, university professor was chosen as the most prestigious profession", I would rephrase to something along the lines of "In a 1951 survey, the most prestigious profession was chosen to be that of the university professor." The wording of the original did not immediately make it clear to me that you were talking about university professors in general, rather than a particular university professor (especially being that Heinrich von Treitschke is pictured immediately to the right of it). I feel like the sentence immediately afterwards can also be broken up into two. The final sentence may serve better as a good attention-grabbing first sentence of that paragraph.

In the second paragraph of the section "A Bitter Defeat", a hyperlink or definition of "revanchism" would be useful.

If I am not mistaken, the "O" in "Volkische" has an umlaut over it (Ã–). If you cannot type an umlaut over the o, using "oe" in its place is the proper alternative.

A bit of extra explanation of the "revisionist ends" of the Weimar Voelkish historians might be helpful for the reader.

A hyperlink or explanation of "positivism" might also be useful in the section about conservative-nationalist ideas of objectivity.

Overall, this is a very well written essay. Having put myself in the shoes of someone who knows absolutely nothing about the topic, I feel it would give me a good overview of the methods and attitudes surrounding the subject of history and its writing under the Nazi regime. Despite this, there are a few technical improvements that could be made, as well as some more detail given, so as to make all of the concepts discussed explicitly clear in the writing. Other than that the only other criticism I can really give are that the structure of the second paragraph be revised and that the one sentence there that I had quoted be rephrased in order to make more clear the point which that sentence is making. In that same paragraph I would also maybe reposition the captioned image to not interfere so much with the paragraph and in particular that sentence, as it did distort what I had thought the sentence was trying to say. Other than those few criticisms I'd say that you've managed to craft a very thoughtful and informative essay.
