author 1: jackie - Romanticism: A Brief Introduction to Romantic History

Picture is great size maybe just title picture: Liberty Leading... a reflection of nationalistic romaticism art during 1830. 

Opening Section: What is Romanticism: is well said and easy to read. I do not see any typos or broken thoughts. This is strung well together for any reader. She explains what romantic history is and why it is important and why it began. 

Second Section: Nationalism and Romanticism What is Romantic History: Flows well from previous section. No typos or lost thoughts. great use of citations. There really is not obvious issues that I can see. still follows well how romanticism evolved in history, why it was important, and how it effected at that time. 

Third Section: Historians of the Romantic Age: leave out lives of everyman and just "to utilize the lives of individuals to ..." 
also forgot to put name next to page number is a couple citations here. 

Forth Section: Historians of the Romantic Age could be better after the opening. gives a solid background before we go into the philosophy of romaniticsm ect.This section has no typos and well done.should follow third section and should possibly move towards beginning. Puncation is good, sentences are well structured. no errors.

Fifth Section:Conclusion:leave out the title conclusion. well rounded conclusion with no typos or errors that I can see.

Overall this is well written and she has taken time to make sure she finishes her thoughts. Minor edits as forementioned but seems to me excellent. 

Citations: correct citations, no need fo web address, and remove publishing. other than that citations look like they are correctly done, in order, correct italics, and page number included. 

narrative overview
The over of the piece is regarding what Romanticism is and how it effected that time period and inspired historical change. It speaks to Englightenment, the predecessor of Romanticism, the Romantic phiolophies of various historical writers of that time and the effects they had on historical events. paragraph lengths was great, not too much or too little. Attention to details of romanticism was easy to follow. This paper is explicit on what the subject. remove pg. in bibiolograpghy.

author 2: red - the great war

Section 1: Introduction: still need subtitle, maybe different title of this section other than introduction. "These texts today are a window in a time since pasted and arenâ€™t always linear in their delivery of this story as there are many factors that have shape the perspectives of those who were involved".-might be a little abstract.- no typos

picture:
too large, and needs a lable with time period. 

Section 2: National Perspectives: englarge title with ###. 
"The biggest loser" does not examine how germany percieved this and how they became agrian by forces which is what lead to the second world war. They were forced to accept defeat.

narrative overview:
Overall, how did this change event (The Great War) change/effect historical writing? It is not clear and seems to be more of a historical report on this era rather than how it effected historical writing or thinking. I think you have a lot of great information and it is easy to read with little errors however you need to tie this in how historical writing was before and then after the war itself. how did the great war effect historical writing? Did it change Western culture or just Germany? this seems more like a lesson in history. Explain linear for the reader. How it came about, and how it changed. Sources are revelent to topic. Had three images. no jargon
Just need to figure out the 'so what'. Reads well other than that.
