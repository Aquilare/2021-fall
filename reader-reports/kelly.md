# Alex’s *Microhistory* Essay Review #
### What is Microhistory Section ###
-	*The Cheese and the Worm* needs to be italicized, also have the correct spelling of the title
-	Don’t forget that the in-text citation goes (Last-Name, #)—don’t forget the comma!
-	Not Ginzburg’s—just Ginzburg
-	1st paragraph, 2nd sentence is rough. Maybe try, “Although Ginzburg has often been stated as the first person to use the term *microhistory*, it was actually George R. Steward in 1959, then Luiz Gonzalez (Ginzburg, 10-12).”
-	I do this too, but try not to start sentences with “but,” it’s a fluff word
-	1st paragraph, 4th sentence: “how practitioners view of microhistory”—get rid of “of”
-	Last sentence of 1st paragraph needs a bit of rework
-	I think your 2nd paragraph, “Microhistory is a practice aimed to return…” should be the 1st sentence of the 1st paragraph
-	This first section should be 2 paragraphs, I’d recommend adding the 2nd paragraph to the first, then splitting it and adding the 3rd paragraph to that split.
### Multiple Practices of Microhistory ###
-	Italian(s)—don’t forget the “s”
-	I would italicize *microstoria* since it is a foreign term
-	Rework the 1st sentence, it’s a good 1st sentence but the grammar and flow are off
-	Who is Levi?
-	“Another characteristic of Italian microhistory is *that* instead of…”—you need “that” in this sentence
-	Don’t forget grammar, commas are your best friend if you want long sentences
-	“Either culturally or *through the* social line of thinking…”—I would add “through the” to flow the sentence
-	“Between the cultural and socio-economic” what?
-	Run-on sentences, be careful.
-	“French microhistory on the took what the Italian microhistory is that similar to the Italian thought”—confusing sentence here.
-	“Micro history”—don’t forget to keep spelling consistent
-	Make sure that you’re writing in the same tense; tries/tried/try, consistency for writing
-	Like I said, I do it too, I add a lot of fluff words, so I’d just try to get some of the words that don’t help you get to your point. (1st sentence, 3rd paragraph of this section is an example of this)
-	The last paragraph of this section is long, so I’d either split it
-	For your photo caption: Better but I would: add dates for Levi, italicize *microstoria*, and give Ginzburg’s full name.
### Micro vs Marco ###
-	I think this section should be before *Multiple Practices of Microhistory* just because it gives more background, 
-	If you do decide to bring the section up, give a **brief** explanation as to what macrohistory is since the ideal reader is someone who probably doesn’t know the difference between the two.
-	Make sure you’re consistent with spelling/grammar (i.e., micro-macro/Micro-Macro)
-	What is “this” in the 1st paragraph, last sentence?
-	2nd paragraph, 1st sentence—if this is a citation, don’t forget quotation marks; if this is an idea you have inferenced, it needs to be reworded because its clunky right now
-	Also, when talking about *just* microhistory, make sure you’re spelling out the entire word
-	But if you’re talking about the “micro” of microhistory, I’d maybe try italicizing or putting it into quotation marks it just to make it clear to the reader that there is a distinction
-	**Great Segway to the next section**, that sets the flow!
### Biography and Microhistory ###
-	**Good first sentence**, let’s me know what this next section and paragraph is going to be about
-	“Which can rase the question is a biography a microhistory.”— I would try, “This similarity can raise the question on whether biography is a version of microhistory.”
-	**Great citation, good quote at the end**
-	“With the different questions and that most subjects are not living, a microhistorian does not…”—I would try, “With different questions and the fact that most subjects are not living…”
-	I think this is a very strong section
### How *The Cheese and the Worm* Came to Be ###
-	Good on you for correcting the subtitle, but I think in this context its “be” not “being”
-	Don’t forget to italicize titles
-	1st sentence is rough, I’m not sure what you’re trying to say…
-	“Carlo Ginzburg back in the 1960s began to look”—try, “Back in the 1960s, Carlo Ginzburg…”
-	“This look at how…” What is “this” in the sentence?
-	I think the 2nd paragraph needs rework; I see what point you’re trying to make but I don’t think it’s 100% clear
-	For your photo caption, who is he? Give him a name and dates, it helps to put the face to the name for the reader. I’d also give more information on his book and *why* it’s been called one of the founding books of microhistory
### Benefits for the Use of Microhistory ###
-	**Good first sentence**
-	I don’t know if “feeling” is the best word for what you’re trying to say in this paragraph, try “sense”
-	Small section, very nice though
### Criticism of Microhistory ###
-	I think for flow, this section should go before *Benefits for the Use of Microhistory*
-	“One of the many criticisms *of* microhistory is that…”—instead of “that” use “of”
-	**Great first sentence though**, nice hook into the paragraph/section
-	2nd paragraph, 1st sentence, “… being *that* generalities of the past allow the question of the validity…”— I would add “that” to flow the sentence better
### Microhistory and the Future ###
-	1st paragraph, 1st sentence, “that microhistory has one can seem to believe that microhistory is falling out of favor.” This part needs work, it’s a *good first sentence** for the paragraph/section.
-	I think you could scrap the *Conclusion* subtitle because technically *Microhistory and the Future* sounds like a good concluding section. So, combine the last two sections.

Hey Alex! Your essay is very well researched, and I can tell you’ve put the work in. There are just small grammar and flow problems that need to be fixed. I think Karli’s suggestion of getting Grammarly is a *really* good idea, just because it will help you identify the issues with spelling, grammar, and consistency. Also, we touched on it in class, but I think you need to restructure the essay so that it flows like this:
-	What is Microhistory
-	Micro vs Macro
-	Multiple Practices of Microhistory
-	Biography and Microhistory
-	How *The Cheese and the Worm* Came to Be
-	Criticism of Microhistory
-	Benefits for the Use of Microhistory
-	Microhistory and the Future (in combination with Conclusion)

I think you could use one or two more photos, and some block quotes just to add some more visual likeness to the essay so that readers are visually drawn to the essay. I’m sorry if I went a little too hard on the corrections, but its only because I think this essay is **really** good, it just needs finesse and you’re looking at a great product in the end. Don’t forget to correct your in-text citations. Altogether, I think you have a pretty good essay, good job!

# Donnie’s *Narrativity* Essay Review #
-	Two titles, just a mild repeat
-	I like that you italicized your subtitle in the beginning, but I think to break up the paper you need subtitles, images, and block quotes.
-	**Great opening paragraph**, let’s me know what the paper is about without being too technical and overwhelming—perfect for the ideal reader
-	I personally don’t like when an essay says “in this essay” because can be smoother ways to preface the content of your paper
-	Make sure you stay consistent with the structure of the paper, like paragraph spacing between the 3rd and 4th paragraph.
-	Break up some of the long paragraphs so it’s easier to read (5th paragraph could be two)
-	5th paragraph: Narrative is capitalized—did you mean to do that? Also, don’t forget to italicize titles like *Rewriting the Newspaper*
-	5th paragraph: Some of the sentences could be combined to make flow easier, for example: “In Rewriting the Newspaper, Thomas R. Schmidt explores the use of narrative history in the news. It is an overview of the improvements story telling brought to the newspaper industry.”
-	5th paragraph: “This looks at the induction of storytelling…” what is “this” referring to in this context?
-	In-text citations should be (Last-Name, #) so you don’t need the p. or pg. in the citation
-	A good photo/image opportunity would be after the 5th paragraph when you bring up Alun Munslow! You could get a photo of him there, that way the reader can put a name to the face for the historian you’re talking about
-	Another great photo/image opportunity would be for your paragraph on Hayden White
-	Don’t forget to get titles italicized, like in the 9th paragraph with *The Fiction of Narrative*
-	Also, for that citation, I’d double check with Prof. Gibbs, but I don’t think you need to include in-text the editor—it gets a little clunky (never mind, I understand *why you have this included, but I still think it can be smoothed out)
-	If you do want to include who the editor is, I would better incorporate it into the paragraphs—you talked about Robert Doran in the 9th paragraph, then continued with it in the 9th paragraph, maybe just have him be the subject of the 10th paragraph
-	12th paragraph: *Our Knowledge of the Past* needs to be italicized
-	13th paragraph is a bit small, could probably help split the next paragraph…
-	“A sense of balance develops within…” Another big paragraph that needs to be split.
-	14th paragraph: **amazing** first sentence, that is a good hook, you could honestly put it at the very beginning as your introduction sentence.
-	14th paragraph, don’t forget to italicize *Theorizing Historical Consciousness*
-	The quotes that you are using are **really good** they support your paper very well.
-	“The problem of form in historical writing is also peculiarly acute because not only must the historian represent the complexity of past experience, but [he] must also represent it in the movement of time.” (Marwick, p152)—this could potentially be a good block quote that will give your essay some shape!
-	I’d recommend a more forward conclusion
-	Don’t forget to title/subtitle your bibliography!

Hey Donnie! I really liked your essay, there is a lot of great information in there, and your grammar is on point. There were some issues with your citations, but those are easy fixes. I think your essay could benefit from subtitles, that way the ideal reader can scroll through and get a sense of what the essay is going to be about. I like the tone of your essay; it works extremely well given the subject of narrative—your narrative is good. The flow is nice and natural. I think you’re very lucky to have some historians in there that you can include as images/photo opportunities. Overall, you have a great essay and I’m excited for the final product because it already has the content, it just needs the icing on top of the cake!
