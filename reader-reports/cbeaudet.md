## Eric Galbiso: Early Soviet Union Historiography

I immediately stopped after the first sentence and I have some suggestions. First, the events you describe lack articles that inhibit the flow of the sentence. Secondly, it appears to me that the first sentence is a statement of fact and not the hook it needs to be. Perhaps make it more thematic. It is also very dense and could be shortened a little bit. Third, if the first sentence is supposed to convey to me the big idea of Historiography and the SU, then I only comprehend that Historiography was hampered by conflict and warfare. I need to know its significance.

The second issue I run into at the start of your essay is conciseness. The last sentence of the first paragraph needs revision, I had to read it several times to understand what was being conveyed. Same with the first sentence of the second paragraph, it can be simplified and convey the same idea. These are not the only areas of conciseness, as it is consistent throughout. 

It is my assumption, that the last sentence of the second paragraph is your thesis. You are breaking up this sentence with commas that break its flow and makes it hard to comprehend. As a thesis, its weak as it does not convey a universal truth. In fact, if this sentence was reworded, it should belong at the top as your first sentence and thematic statement.  

Another sticking point for me is relevance. Under the heading Marxists and Non-Marxists, you introduce some facts and never really expand on it. For example, what is the Communist Academy? What does this have to do with the Society of Marxist Historians? What exactly is Istpar? Is this a latinized spelling of a Cyrillic word? Is it an abbreviation? It is kind of just dropped there and serves no purpose than to just exist. If your goal is to introduce these things as important, then they need context. 

It is important to use Italics when emphasizing titles or works. 

Read your sections allowed and follow along carefully, you are missing several pronouns and words in some sentences.

If “dean of Soviet history” is a title attributed to Pokrovsky, then it is a proper noun and needs to be capitalized. Ex. “Dean of Soviet History”.

I would say, you accomplished what you set out to do in the last sentence of the second paragraph of the essay. Trotsky, Pokrovsky, and Stalin are the best sections of this essay while suffering minorly from my criticisms. Make sure you make historiographical connections with important works that support the points you make. 

## Heath Skroch: Marxist Historiography

When I began reading your essay, I found your first sentence wanting. It tells me nothing of the content of the essay besides that Karl Marx and Fredrich Engles were German Philosophers and they lived in the 19th century. Your opening statement needs significance and is what needs to hook me as a reader. It is nothing more than a statement of fact. 

Where is your thesis? What is the truth of this essay? Why should I care about Marxist Historiography?

This is likely because of coding why italics don’t exist in this essay nor Erics, however you need to ensure that Italics are used when emphasizing titles and works. 

There are various occasions where you need to use commas, such as:
“These two classes(,) as well as their social and political arrangements(,) are what encompass the ‘relations of production.”

Proper verb tenses need to be examined upon reread. There are occasions where verbs will be in present tense when the sentence structure is inexplicably clear that something happened in the past.

Mercantilism, socialism, and capitalism should not be capitalized unless as an event or title. 

Formatting on github is unclear to me. However, when you introduce a quotation that involves at least three lines of text, you need to: apply a colon, indent the whole quote, and cite it. 

Example:

“Here he states: 
> ‘Legal relation as well as forms of state are to be grasped neither by themselves nor from the so-called general development of the human mind, but rather have their roots in the material conditions of life…’ (Citation, Page)
Marx explains that…”

Maybe I am being picky, but the paragraph under Marxism and Government is too big and can be halved for flow. 

A conclusion is necessary in this piece to summarize the thesis and the content thereof. 

The narrative flow was good, and I was able to follow along nicely, with a few hiccups on the way. There were a lot of spelling and tense errors, capitalization errors, among others. However, that’s sort of outside the scope of what I am to address and it’s a first draft anyways.
