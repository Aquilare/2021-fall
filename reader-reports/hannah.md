# Medieval Russian/ Tsavist Historigraphy by Christopher Beaudet

- I felt like the essay could have used either more pictures or maybe more specific longer comments explainings the pictures.
- I know that under the Bibliography heading it says to be added, but just make sure they are placed in the order of use and in the proper format.
- Don't be afraid to quote directly from the sources you used. It can be helpful to understand where your getting your information.
- I felt like the paragraphs even under the same heading felt a bit out of sync, so maybe find a way to make the ending of each paragraph to flow into the next.
- There were a few grammical and spelling errors, but an easy fix.

Overall, I thought the essay was very imformative, and easy to digest. I felt like it was a good start to a very interesting topic. 
I was trying to read this with the eyes of someone needing research for a school paper and from the lens of someone who is very imformed of the subject. 
When I did that, there were a few moments when I had to go back and reread something that I thought I'd missed, but it was just the way in which it was written that was a bit confusing.
The pictures were thoughfully placed and it overall felt like the essay was pretty easy to read.

# Romanticism by Jackie Truitt

- It felt like the references that were used were prpoerly quoted, but some of the quotatipon references were missing.
- There were good use of pictures and the comments under them were short and still well explained.
- I was thinking that if you didnt want to use the author reference after each quote, you could use footnotes to let the reader know where you got your information.
- The flow was a bit rocky, meaning that with each paragraph it seemed like the flow of them wasn't quiet there. Try to connect and relate each paragraph to one another in some way to make it flow easier.
- Very inforative and interesting topic well explained.

Overall, the story you were trying to tell was very interesting and inforative and, if, looking at it through the eyes of an outside source whether that be expert or your average history buff, it was very easy to follow through and read through the whole thing.
Very engaging without being boring, I thought the topic was interesting and the way it was written with the execption of a few grammical errors, was fun and energetic.
