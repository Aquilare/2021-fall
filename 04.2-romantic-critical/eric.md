Romantic historians put more emphasis on the artistic view of history. These historians would try and help the reader visualize history as one would view a painting or write their histories with more drama to tell an interesting story. They would use their artistry to help shape nationalistic identities and put more emphasis on the individual’s role.

Critical history was the development of modern techniques for historical history. It was the embrace of studying primary documents as well as analyzing how accurate these documents were. Critical analysis of primary documents turns this study into more of a science with “testing” whether the primary or secondary evidence can be trusted fully or more as a framework of a historical person or event.

History is both truth and art. Wilhelm von Humboldt strives to show that through history, truth about events and people can be found. There is also a large emphasis on how history is art because history can give people an idea what life and past events was like.

What interested me most about what von Humboldt’s idea of what a historian should do is his emphasis on the arts. von Humboldt wants historians to write for everyone by making it understandable. He wants the historian to paint a picture of what was while being as true to the actual events of history as possible. To me, he sounds like he would have been a great documentarian that would create interesting works of history for the masses.

Can a romantically tinted view of history be as trusted as a critical view?
