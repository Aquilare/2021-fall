With this chapter of Cheng's book, we see history through two distinct, but not mutually exclusive, methods of thought. Both Romantic and Critical histories during this period come into their own, each advancing the concept of nationalism and progress forward. 

Unlike Enlightenment thinkers, the historians of the 19th century, both romantic and critical alike, looked at the past and attempted to understand it from the perspective of the past, as opposed to implementing modern viewpoints and ideals where they did not necessarily belong.

Romantic historians looked at history as an art, applying aesthetical positions relating to beauty and the natural world in their works. While romantic historians were primarily concerned with ensuring that readers were entertained through the flowery and beautiful language which could make the past come alive, they didn't completely disregard a commitment to objective historical sources. It was the romantic historian who's responsibility it was to use their art as a lamp, to eluminate the truth. 

Critical history, on the other hand, was viewed as a science. Focusing on facts and a critical analysis of a slew of primary sources such as archival papers and manuscripts from the time period, critical historians could piece together the truth of what happened in a streamlined and objective manner. 

What is so fascinating to me about these two methods is their ability to be intertwined into a way to view and interpret history. So far, this idea of a romantic viewpoint has been the most intriguing to me, at least from this basic introductory view of it. My exposure to history as a youngster was through books and movies which sucked me into the past. This is exactly the point of romanticism. While there may be deeper problems involved with romantic historical thought, at surface level, this is an attractive and often effective way of getting a broader audience involved in the historical process. 

Ranke, illustrates a good example of the combination of the two methods thriving together. Cheng explains that Ranke delved deep into archival sources to ensure the factual, scientific truth of history, but in his writings he saw history as a literary art form which could be used to create suspense and intrigue. 

Just because historical writing has been based on a critical analysis of sources to ensure validity, it doesn't mean it has to be dull and one note, devoid of the ability to transport the reader. 

A few questions:
1. Do you agree with Cheng and I that romanticism and critical thought do not have to be mutually exclusive?
2. Do you think that romanticism is an effective way of exposing larger audiences to history as a discipline?
