I would say that the key differences between Romantic and Critical history is the authors way of writing history. 
Romantic historians wanted to recreate the events of the past for the reader, and help them understand what people of the past went through during the events.
Critical historians of the time sought to discover and write confirmed facts, wanting to find the true facts of any historical event.
Romantic historians were much more concerned with emotion, and they wrote with emotions in order to bring their history to "life" and help people feel involved themselves.
In contrast, Critical historians wanted to distill as much truth as possible from their sources, with as little emotional or personal bias as possible. 

Von Humboldts article details how a historian should write history, which seems to be a mixture of both Romantic and Critical writing styles. 
He writes that historians have to not only present facts to their audience, they have to use their own knowledge and intuition to connect these events into a coherent narrative.
He cautions against being to into the storytelling and losing sight of the facts, while not connecting the facts into a story also misses the point of writing and detailing historical events.
His writing of history seems to be a mix of both the Romantic and Critical styles, with historians attempting to craft critical and unbiased narratives of events. 
I think the most interesting part of this was how he likended a historians job to that of a poet, and how it is almost inevitable to need to use imagination at times when writing. 

Questions
1. Is it even possible to have a "perfect" way of writing history?
2. How closely does modern history writing resemble von Humboldts ideas?
