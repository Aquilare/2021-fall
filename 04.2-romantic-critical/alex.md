### Romatic and Critical History
The biggest key difference between Romantic and Critical history is that the Critical historian was all about being more scientific and presenting the facts as they were. Critical historians, like Ranke, wanted to be objective in history. This required the careful examination of text for inaccuracies. This led the critical historians to see history as a science and that history did not need to show moral example for societies to follow. And that history can be shown by using historical events as causes and not the will of divine will.

Romantic historians on the other hand thought of themselves as artist and used language to tell a vivid history where there were facts, but the facts were not the main part of history. The other thing that romantic historians did was see the past was different from the present and understood the differences between the times. 
This now does not mean that the two thoughts were exclusive as was talked about in the chapter and the two thoughts were used in combination. 
### Wilhelm von Humboldt 
One the first examples in Wilhelm von Humboldt article is the first line to present what actually happened which lines up with the Ranke school of thought being German. Another example that ties the two readings is Wilhelm von Humboldt’s claim “Like all other scholarly work history serves many ancillary purposes; but in itself history is no less an art, free and self-contained, than are philosophy and literature” (von Humboldt page 60). Showing that there is still some room for romantic style of writing and that history is a science and an art. 

What I found interesting about Wilhelm von Humboldt idea of the purpose of the historian is the idea of finding the “soul” of the event or the unseen factors. And that with trying to find the unseen factor you also need to imitate the time. This meaning that as a historian you have to give your reader the most realistic picture of the past that you can and be and stay objective. And use the facts and tell a simple tell that does not let the reader come away with half-truths. 
### Questions 
Do you think that Wilhelm von Humboldt article is still applicable to today’s historians?

Why do you think there was a difference in opinion between America and Europe on if history was a profession?
