From what I get, the camps of Romantic history and Critical history are like night and day. The two “genres” have two very different outlooks on the use and outlook on how events and such should be addressed.

First off, the romantic side. Much like the romantic art movement, the history branch is more nationalistic in their approach of the subject in that those on the romantic theater would likely use this history as a justification. For example, during the renaissance, there was a huge focus on the Greek and Roman empire and how successful they were and such, not minding the fact that the Greeks were conquered, and that Rome collapsed. There is a bit of ignorance in their approach, but only say lightly in the sense that in other cases, they acknowledge their fault, but still focus on the glory and grace. Another example is American Exceptionalism as said by Cheng. There is a huge mind in America and there are legends that glorify events in the country’s past.

On the other hand, the critical history is more, well, critical. It doesn’t much glorify as it more scrutinizes the event, be it in a positive light or negative. The way that the critical acts as a polar opposite to the romantic. The realism is the more prevalent in that, as von Humboldt put it, “to present what actually happened” and that is more matter of factly than the romantics.
