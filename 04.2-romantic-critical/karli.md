**Romantic History** and its concepts were in large part influenced by the social proclivity of that time period (ca. 1815-1890) 
as seen in its *looking back* to the Medieval and Gothic periods for a sense of the dramatic emotionality of the human experience.  
Histories in the Romantic era echoed this ideal in its use of narrative and highly sensationalized language and with its focus on 
the individual and emotionalism.  

This seems to be a contrast to the **Critical History** approach, as seen in Ranke and Bancroft’s work, which is that topics of
research should be approached on their own merits and for their own sake, and that *critical* use of primary sources and accurate 
citations and footnotes were emblematic of the “detached” historian.

Romantic history theory is a huge contrast to the Enlightenment ideals of reason and scientific approaches (systemization and 
rationalization), and this *high emotionality* has come to define much of the overall Romantic movement in many different areas 
including art and music.  Despite this apparent break with earlier historical thought, the Romantic approach presages the idea 
of the historian as the individual who will sort through extant sources in order to present a clear picture of their research, 
all while making their material relatable (dramatic and vivid renditions).  

Ranke emphasized the critical use of primary sources in his own research and writings, which was a continuation of the earlier 
German school of historical thought that began during the Enlightenment.  He also utilized Romance-styled narratives that 
created a sense of artistic representation in his works, bearing the mark of his own time period’s preference for such writings.  

He purported the need for the historian to be both *critical of sources* and *able to separate their own opinions from the* 
*historical facts* as they are.  His ideals of no longer using history to further any political or social agendas was really 
diverging from the previous historiographic approaches we have discussed so far – which is history for its own sake.   **AND** – 
Ranke taught students to use the same methods of research and codified this approach, which was in turn taught 
in universities in Germany.  However, Ranke aided the growth of what Cheng describes as *historicism*, which in Ranke’s view
was the essential fact that all historical events occurred as a result of historical forces and were not due to outside influences
(i.e., religion).  This is something that had been promoted by Voltaire many years earlier, especially as it related to
theological interference.   

Yet, because of Ranke’s own Lutheran beliefs, he still held to the notion that history could be viewed as window into deeper 
spiritual understanding.  This swayed his own approach and emphasized the need to do away with any inconsistent or 
false narratives that critical research would uncover.
