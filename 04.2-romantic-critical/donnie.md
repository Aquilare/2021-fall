# Romancing Critical Analysis 
## _understanding the development of facted based story telling_



As historians developed their work into a formal discipline, argument begun right from the start. Sometimes these arguments took place within the work of a single historian. Ranke laid the groundwork for the use of primary sources and footnotes. This developed the scientific approach used in historical research while holding onto the story telling ways of the romantics. The importance of this skill is not lost on any historian of the modern age, yet without the subtle Romanticization of history, readings can become a little dry. The Challenge becomes a delicate balance of presenting the facts in a compelling way. 

The story itself was an argument too. The debate over what historians should focus on become of concern. The use of one voice over the other led in a way to Nationalism as a personal identity. Beyond being loyal to place and time, it meshed personal stories with that of a country. This is to the jeopardy of the individual and leaves out many details of both place and person.  

The balance and argument then evolve. As does the place and time with the story. Making an awareness of the importance of the historian's job. When history focuses on the military achievements of one nation, the people and the history of that place all merge together as one. Or at least, this scenario has the potential to create such a disbalance in the story. By focusing on the individual, a more complete story emerges. 

The need to argue and implement both approaches is crucial in telling the real story of history. "The crucial difference, which removes all potential dangers, lies in the fact that the historian subordinates his imagination to experience and the investigation of reality." (On The Historians Task) 


- Do we strike the right balance of fact gathering and storytelling?
- Is it possible to tell stories without adding in a fictional way when trying to evoke emotion?
