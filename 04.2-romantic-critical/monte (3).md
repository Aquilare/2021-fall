### Romance and Critical History


I wasn’t well versed on Romanticism so I found the reading more interesting than I initially believed I would. Cheng was quick to point out the stark differences from the Enlightenment thinkers and period as a whole. I enjoyed the lamp and mirror metaphor. As it furthered the point of this Romantic period *illuminating the uniqueness* of a person and understanding history because it should simply be understood.

We see quickly two schools of thought spring up. Critical and Romantic;however, while we do see a little push and pull and sometimes one is preferred over the other, this wasn’t exactly a spot the differences. These thoughts are almost intertwined together. Initially I pictured a textbook riddled with dates and hard information as a Scientific approach and something more along the lines of Dan Carlin as an emotional roller coaster of the Romantic period. In reading I see they aren’t what I had imagined.

Both are trying to discover the truth. Albeit a truth in a different way. I believe that for a successful historical approach one would need both. In trying to find this objective truth one could weave emotion and weave a tapestry. In fact I believe this narrative history is very popular and draws in a very large audience in which it tries to dig emotion and follows a story. Hopefully it keep the truth but sometimes it doesn't quite dig as deep as it should.

We see that Cheng also highlighted and dove deeper into the aspect of Nationalism and how it walked hand in hand with Romanticism in several cases. It was refreshing to see Humboldt point back to the partnership or balancing act. While Humboldt seemed apprehensive toward the Romantic style but only when it **sacrifices** truth for the sake of an emotional response or good story. I think this is a fair response.


1. We see what can happen if a nation sacrifices truth for a romantic lense? What happens if we forgo the romantic for a fully critical view of history?
2. Will the study of history continue to evolve or is it still evolving?
