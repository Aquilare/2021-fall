Postmodern history sees a big change in what the focus and point of history is. Historians of this time seem to be shifting away from writing only about big singular events or people or even politics, and focusing more on smaller movements and the bigger picture in general. These writers were more interested in the everyday social lives of people, and how they showed how society had changed throughout history as a whole. The whole notion of objectivity was questioned, its importance and whether or not it was even possible to have a truly objective history. 

Postmodern changes in history should be seen as more evolutionary, because as different as they are from past history writing they still built upon previous ways of thinking and studying history. Postmodern history is very skeptical and its change in focus and topics seem revolutionary when looking at the sudden shift. While postmodern history seems like a huge change from previous movement concerning historical writing, I imagine that it never would have happened had it not been able to build off of the movements of the past. 


Questions

1. Can history exist without narrative? Has there ever been a history book that was just a list of facts?
2. Is it better for a reader if a writer admit their objective in the beginning, or if they have to guess it after reading?
