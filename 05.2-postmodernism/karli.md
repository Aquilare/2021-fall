Understanding the concepts that are embodied by Postmodernist historical thought incorporated a multiple number of subjects and arguments that were made by researchers of the time.  These arguments were spurred on by events that took place during and after WWII, which created the impetus for the majority of social changes seen during the protest movements of the mid-20th century and afterwards.  

As we have already seen in the other periods of historiography so far, the study of history is shaped by surrounding social and cultural environments of that time.  These changes in Postmodernist history are **not** *revolutionary*, but rather are *evolutionary* in that historical studies have continued to be crafted according to shifting human needs.

Essentially, there were two schools of thought that varied greatly in their approach to *postmodernist history* overall: big picture and overarching causal studies as opposed to social history and the emphasis on individual people or events that could be somewhat representative of their greater cultural context.

The **Annales School** in France focused on the *longué dureé*, the long-view of how the underlying environment and cultural power structures and social trends were a method to understanding and relating a more complete historical picture.  This could be a continuation of what some historians in the 19th century had sought to achieve by the introduction of *scientific methods* in the research of historical information and codified presentations of their data (**Ranke** and his grad school seminars).  The work of this school was highly analytical, and lacked the dramatization that public history had utilized for so long, making for less-than thrilling narrative readings.

What sharply contrasted to this wholistic view was the fragmentation that Cheng described in reference to figures like **Jesse Lemisch**, who rallied for the use of social history to highlight the issues that arose during the post-WWII protest movements.  Lemisch made no qualms about openly espousing his agenda surrounding his work, especially since he was seen as an “activist historian”.  This is an exact continuation of the versions of historical thought we have discussed and read about wherein the historian’s agenda is overt and apparent.  For example, the ideas of Protestant history as written by **Bradford** are in the same vein as those of Lemisch, each with a social or religious agenda in mind within their writings.

The social historical approach focused in on the individual events and lives of singular people to demonstrate an overarching narrative.  With this sharper focus, the use of **Narrative History** was again embraced, and some historians admittedly embellished these narrative stories when they lacked facts (again to create a complete narrated picture).  This critically harmed narrative historical formats, which some in academia felt was beneath the profession and therefore inadequate.  

*For Further Thought:*

How has the need for objective truth created the issues surrounding historical fragmentation?

How can writing and presenting history not include, to some degree, narrative elements?
