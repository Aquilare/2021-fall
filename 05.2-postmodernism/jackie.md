#  Postmodernism 

To me, it is no surprise that advances in Postmodernistic thinking coincides with the end of traumatic events, social and cultural change, and major population booms. In this chapter, Cheng describes that in Europe following WWII, the Annales school led by Fernand Braudel championed a historical viewpoint which shyed away from political agendas and focused on collaborative and interdiciplinary research. 

In the United States in the 1950s and 60s following WWII as well as the Korean War, and during the uncertainty and hostility that was the Vietnam War, we see changing historical viewpoints with the 'new social historians.' Whereas in Europe the wars and violence shaped historical thinking to be almost apolitical, the US new historians such as Jesse Lemisch were using their historical platform to their political advantage. 

The population following these wars has also skyrocketed, and naturally, more people equals more opinions, and therefore more viewpoints on the "correct" way things should be done. Historiographically, this rise of postmodernism meant that people had access to more information, and their own biases and lenses which with to view the world through. 

The paradigm shift that comes with post-modern history, therefore, isn't a completely new way of understanding or practicing history, but a much more complex amalgamation. The evolution of historiography culminating at this point in postmodernism is a combination of just about everything else we have seen up to this point, albiet with some new concepts thrown in, and viewed from a modern cultural and social lens. 

With so many viewpoints, it is no wonder that there has been and is such discourse and contention towards how history is viewed and practiced. As someone who is learning about much of this for the first time, and who can see pros and cons in every school of historical thought that we have studied so far, I keep coming back to the same thing...**Who says it has to be this specific way for it to matter?** 

The concept of authority throughout history, whether openly questioned or not, will **always** be there. 

I find it interesting to read about historians who have such strong opinions about how history should be practiced. There are times that I agree very strongly with a point that Cheng has made regarding a certain viewpoint, but then a few pages later I find myself agreeing with another conflicting viewpoint. I wonder what this says about myself? 

A few questions:
1. Do you believe that objectivity (whatever you think that might be) and heavy narrative can co-exist in historical writing? 
2. So far, is there a historical viewpoint that you are more drawn to than others? Are you more social or cultural? Artistic or scientific?
