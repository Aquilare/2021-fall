How does postmodern history constitute a fundamental historiographical paradigm shift?

It seems that in the postmodern turn to history, the enlightenment thinkers and the romantic artists of history are now focussing off course if you will to the overview or bigger picture of history and separating critical thinking to seeing history in a more objective light. In the Historiography reading, the author mentions how there's a new focus on skepticism, “...the possibility of objective knowledge about the past, revealing how postmodernism had come to be used as a term of opprobrium even against historians who did not fully subscribe to its tenets”. It seems like maybe the way historians think about history and that the purpose historians had has now changed in this new wave of skeptical and objective thinking.

Why should we see postmodern changes in historical practice as more evolutionary than revolutionary?

I think that these changes to the way historians perceive history and its purpose has changed over time and that it wasn't something that happened all at once like most revolutions tend to do. I think that the way historians opposed each other in the beginning of the Renaissance believing in the history the church was providing versus the history of the scholars evolved into philosophical thinking and separating church and science, and then in the Enlightenment, historians found their own voices and formed their own opinions on how and why studying history was so important. Then in the wave of romantic versus critical era, historians began to question the differences between art and literature when studying through a history lens, and now I feel like things again are evolving to asking how history and the study keep changing and the skepticism that is blossoming from this new way of thinking. 

Two questions

How does one keep the evolution of thinking about history going without staying too far from the original purpose in which historians have determined as reasons to study history?
What makes this new wave of thinking about history different and individual from the waves that have come before it and the ones to come after?
