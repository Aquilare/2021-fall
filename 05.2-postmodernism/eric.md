Postmodern history shifted even more into focusing on the individual. Historians in the somewhat contemporary times started to realize that history was not just presidents, generals, or “great men”; It was everyday people that could define what and how it was to live in the time that historian was writing about.

The shift and need to focus on “unimportant” people came about because of all the racial and political change occurring during the 1960s and 1970s. Historians wanted to use their platform to show that the underrepresented races and lower classes were not being written in the histories the way they should have been. We have talking about historians having an agenda and in the case of the postmodern historians it was to show how wrong their profession had been by leaving out the marginalized people of society.

Postmodern changes to history are definitely more of an evolution than revolution because historians had already begun to start writing and focusing on the individual. Postmodern history just added “unimportant people” to write about. This shift also started to involve more culture specific history such as women and Chicanos.

I like that there are cultural studies programs, but I do sort of agree with Thomas Bender in that it feels as though these programs are breaking up a linear history. It is great to have deep dive degrees and classes, but they do tend to feel like they are excluding other history that surrounds that topic. Nothing happens in a bubble and breaking up our history the way Cheng’s chapter describes feels like there is not one cohesive history for all. 

Microhistories are an interesting topic in this chapter that I had not thought of in these terms. I like the idea they were going for by focusing on one event and extrapolating a whole history from just that single event. This idea makes history seem more scientific, but I do not think that it could actually work the way they intend. 

People always say that everyone experiences the same event but in a different matter which is true, and which is why a microhistory extrapolation does not work. A historian can get a general idea of how that event should written about as a whole but the entire society is not going to remember it that exact same way.

How do we draw the line between a cultural studies class and a history class? I have taken Chicano Studies classes before and there seemed to be very little difference between a history class.

Are micro and social histories are helpful to the overall history?
