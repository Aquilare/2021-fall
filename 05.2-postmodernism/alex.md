### Postmodernism
Postmodernism can be seen as both a paradigm shift and as a natural evolution of History. The reason behind this is you can see the gradual change from how history has been written to how history was written in the postmodern era. But on the other hand, it was a major change the beginning with social history put shed light on marginalized groups and that history had been “highjacked” by only writing histories of powerful individuals for too long. Basically, social historians wanted to look at other histories be that African history, Gender history and the methods varied widely depending on the historian. For example, the wanting to write history “from the bottom” from Jesse Lemisch saying that past American history only looked at the elites and their viewpoints as the viewpoint of the American people as a whole. The other way it was a paradigm shift is that the belief that reason and science was not the root to human progress. That history is just a viewpoint of the historian writing it and that how the conflicts in historical accounts was based more on moral and aesthetics than reality as Elieen Ka- May Cheng stated.

Now for the natural evolution of history writing. The movement from politics to other topics had already started to take form during the Enlightenment and fully matured in postmodernism. That the writing of the past talking about the powerful persons was already, in a way, naturally falling out of favor. It can also be seen as a natural evolution by the postmodernist historians changing their viewpoints. Another is that the postmodern historian wanted to become more objective and to portray a more accurate past than their predecessors. 

Overall, postmodernism is both a paradigm shift and the natural evolution of history when one takes a step back and looks at historiography. 
### Opinion
Postmodernist historians in my opinion are trying to bake a historical cake but they do not have a recipe on how to do it. Meaning that the historians can not make this “cake” too bland with data and dates but on the other hand they cannot add too many spices by making the writing too romantic. That they are trying to make their “cake” as close to the historical truth that they have never seen. 


### Questions 
Has the want to be more objective to the past made us more subjective?

In a Postmodern history does History have an actual purpose?  Other than telling a story about the past.
