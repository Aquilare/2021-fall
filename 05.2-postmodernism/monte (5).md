### Postmodern History

Like most views of history we’ve studied thus far, **Postmodern History** was a product of the time. Building on the blocks from the past it evolved from the ideas in order to shape itself as a reflection of the period. Major social changes that included WWII and the 1960’s protest including what followed events such as these provided an idea of history that in part tried to as Cheng says “ *turned debates over how to approach history into debates over the attainability of truth itself.*”

Highlighting the **Annales school** which itself tried to depart in many ways from the traditional line of thinking in terms of view of history. We see another challenge to the linear view of history. Ideas that challenged the Great men and wars of history style of explaining historical events.

The members of the school had direct interaction with the dark side of the vast war (WWII) and we can see some interesting views come from it. Such as the idea from **Fernand Braudel** which saw history in levels. These levels try to divert from just seeing history as political events or explosive news catching events. Also economic and social thinking that changed slowly over time, another layer including geographic points that altered history.
	
This idea sort of stretched out history and created and allowed several different ways to focus on the same period. Battles, wars, and revolutions played only a small part in Braudel’s view. History could be the history of **anything** in this sense. A stark departure from a single line history or major human events. This thinking seemingly came from the escape of hardship or suffering.

Social history started to rise such as history of cultures, events of certain cultures, and in depth views of people during a point in history. This certainly in part was spurred on by the protest of the period and the striving for **equality** amongst many groups in America. We begin to see stories told from points of view we hadn’t before.

Similar to other periods of history however we see new ideas emerging and a pushback from those who wish to slow or criticize those changes.Cultural historians wanted to sway away from economic and political lense and find more of an anthropological view. The fragmentation narrowed the focus of history to tell the story of specific events or people. Some of the ideas were new but the idea of changing as ideas and events changes and that reflected on thinking was not a new concept.


1. *Can the narrative become too detached from the historical idea that the reader will lose the focus of facts?*
2. *How do we incorporate multiple views of history into a limited scope of time. Such as primary school, or early education?*
