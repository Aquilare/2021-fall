## Bibliography

**Baár, Monika.** “Romantic Historiography in the Service of Nation‐Building,” in *Historians and Nationalism: East-Central Europe in the Nineteenth Century*. Oxford Historical Monographs, Oxford University Press, 2010. 

This chapter of Monika Baár’s book provides a useful overview of how Romanticism and Nationalism are interrelated, as well as an introduction to the historiography of 19th century Eastern European scholars. Baár includes general information regarding continuities and discontinuities between Enlightenment thinking and Romantic thinking, and how the emotionality of the 19th century brought with it interests in the past for its own sake as well as attempts to connect with a broader audience by way of descriptive and beautiful language. Additionally, Baár discusses the importance of the shift away from history writers focusing on members of the nobility and upper classes, to utilizing the lives of the everyman and individual to incorporate and fuel the idea of national pride. She states, interestingly, that while romantic nationalistic historians often intended to write sprawling and complete national histories, they often never finished. I see this being a useful source, but it may also include information that is too specific or scholarly in some cases for an entry-level historiographical essay. 


**Bentley, Michael**. "Romanticism," in *Modern Historiography : An Introduction*. Routledge, 1999.

Similar to the chapter on Romanticism in Cheng's Historiography, this source provides good foundational information regarding the topic. Unlike Cheng's chapter which mixed components of romanticism and critical history, this focuses squarely on the fundamentals of romantic historical thought and writing. Bentley discusses concepts such as the importance of "history as poetry," entertainment, and the use of structured narrative to convey a point. He also highlights influential romantic historians such as Bancroft, Carlyle, Macaulay, and Michelet, discussing their writing as well as their overall personal and professional lives. Bentley also states that while the romantics disagreed with the enlightenment's rigid rationalism, and utilized language in specific and emotive ways, they did not abandon critical thought and analysis. This source will provide great foundational information about romantic history, and can additionally provide further terms, people, and concepts which to research.
