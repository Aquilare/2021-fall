**Delsalle, Paul.** *A History of Archival Practice.* Procter, Margaret, trans. Routledge, 2018.

This book is an extensive overview of the archival profession as it emerged from ancient times to the postmodern era.  However, Delsalle writes detailed information about the rise of the archival profession and discipline as it began in the 19th century.  He includes information on the various schools of archival practice that were established in Italy, Germany, and France and their impact on the archival profession.  He also discusses the impact of major international events, like World War I and II, in how archives were managed and how these events transformed archival theory in terms of preservation and inclusivity and the development of disaster planning within the discipline.  Most importantly, he touches on the feminization of the profession and how modern countries promote and apply their own various systems of archival theory.  He writes about particular professionals who established many of the earlier theoretical standards and also the many modern archivists who are currently shaping the discipline today.  

**Ridener, John.** *From Polders to Postmodernism: A Concise History of Archival Theory.* Litwin Books, 2009.

Unlike Delsalle’s volume on a broad range of archival theory and related histories, John Ridener’s book delves much further into modern archival theory and practices.  He describes the rise of the Dutch Manual and how that impacted archival practices beginning in the 19th century.  He also focuses on two specific figures within the archival profession, Sir Hilary Jenkinson and T.R. Schellenberg.  Both men were influential within the archival disciplines for having developed and published archival administrative guides (manuals) in the early and mid-20th century.  This is a trove of information on how these two men’s theories were used to develop what would be codified as the rise of the archival profession beginning in the 1970’s.  Ridener names five specific archivists (still alive today!) that have continued to shape archival paradigms and publish scholarly works in journals written by and for professional archivists.  Lastly, Ridener contrasts the evolution of the previous theoretical practices with postmodernist thought and makes the argument that (much like what we have learned about from reading Fulbrook) the necessity of archival standards is immensely critical to the continuation of the historical profession.

**Moats, Rachel.** “An Introduction to Archival Practices.” *International Social Science Review* 94, no. 1 (January 2018): 1–9.

Rachel Moats describes in very easy to understand terms the basic principles of archival practices and what they mean for laypeople.  She breaks down the jargon and concepts of archives into simple definitions and writes an overview of how the archival profession has changed since the publication of the Dutch Manual in 1898.  She also describes the distinction between the archival profession and the work of librarians, something which has been somewhat overlooked by Delsalle and Ridener.  Moats also discusses the issues facing the modern archival profession; the inclusion of historically overlooked archival materials and the impact of technology on the field as a whole.  The author cites some incredible references, and many are written by currently important scholars on the subject (including Terry Cook and various recent publications from the Society of American Archivists).  She also debunks some of the myths surrounding the use and access of archives to the public and what impact that has on their overall value as an information repository and an institution.
