This article gives a transnational look at the histography of Spanish Colonial Spain and how the speakers in this article are challenging Europe centered narratives about Colonial Spain and challenging older scholarship that was done on the subject. I think this article is a good resource to see how ideas and examples of Spanish Colonial History is still being challenged by historians today and how looking at Spanish Colonial History through a transnationa lens can help even out the dominant Europocentric takes  that we usually see with topics that have to do with the time period. This article also offers new ideas on how we should be thinking about the Spanish colonial time period and what that means for future scholarship. 

Carolyn, Jonathan Earl. Andrés González De Barcia and the Creation of the Colonial Spanish American Library. University of Toronto Press, 2005

This book focus’s specifically on the historiographical writings of Historian Andres Gonzalez De Barcia and how as it says in the title created the Colonial Spanish American Library. This book is good in showing readers the establishment of a place where information was being stored and distributed for Colonial Spanish America during the Spanish Enlightenment. This book wants to show how Gonzales De Barcia influenced historians in how they study colonial Spanish America today. This book is a good starting point to give insight on how historians were writing not only about the Country of Spain but about its colonial legacy here in the Americas. I think it’s an important aspect for the reader to see when they are learning about the Spanish Enlightenment and its legacy.

This article takes a critical look on Spanish leadership particularly the rules of Charles V and Phillip II and also introduces the idea by Fradera that the Spanish Colonial America was not the starting point of Iberian colonial history but the more of the end point of an even longer process of conquest that had been going on for centuries before. I think this article is interesting to introduce to the reader because it offers a different historiographical look at Spanish Colonial narrative and how it relates to Spanish Enlightenment. I think it’s important to emphasize how much religion and in this case the Spanish State played in how decisions would be made and which direction the Spanish Colonial society and how the new Spanish American colonies will be shaped and affected. 






Fitter, Derek. Spanish Romanticism and the Uses of History: Ideology and the Historical Imagination. Oxford, Legenda, 2006.

In this book Fitter speaks mainly about Spanish Romantic Historiographical narratives at the time of the Spanish Enlightenment. We see the author look at different historical writers of the time and looking closely at the strategies of their arguments. Specifically, he’s looking at two historical writers who were not Spanish but had major influence in Spain. They were Francois Guizot, who was more progressive writer at the time, and Giambattista Vico who had a more cyclical view of the historical narrative. We see the competing narratives battle for intellectual superiority and how politics played a role in the issue. This book is a good resource to explain the competing theories of Historical writing that were affecting the Spanish enlightenment and how these competing ideas from outside voices fought to move Spain forward within the context of the looming institution of the Catholic Church that was ever present. 

Paquette, Gabriel B. Enlightenment, Governance and Reform in Spain and its empire 1759-1808. Basingstoke England; New York: Plagrave Macmillan, 2008.

This book is another good reference for understanding the relationships that were functioning in Spanish society during the Spanish Enlightenment. Paquette shows the different types of historiographical analysis of the Bourbon era in Spain. It will help the readers get a sense of what was going on at the time with how Spain was trying to keep up with its European rivals by looking and reading foreign writers and their historiographical interpretations on trade and the nation state with regards to Bourbon Policies. One of the main points the Author wants to get across is that during this time how Spanish officials were looking to revive Spain and bring back prestige and honor to it. By using the concept of regalism and how that affected the new American colonies that Spain had acquired during the Spanish Enlightenment. 

Schmidt-Nowara, Christopher. The conquest of history: Spanish Colonialism and National Histories in the 19th century. University of Pittsburg Press, 2006. 

This book is another good look at Spanish Colonial rule and how Nowara is going to question some historians’ positions on the “Black Legend” and where Christopher Columbus’s place is in the historical narrative. Nowara’s study on Spanish Colonialism also takes him in new directions as to how the Spanish leadership began to look at past Historians to try to continue to justify its Empire in the latter half of Spanish colonial rule. I like this source because it goes in depth on the historiography of “The Black Legend” and why its legacy led to opinions that casual readers of History still have to day with regards to Spain and how the “Black Legend” affected Spain’s reputation among Historians. 

Schmidt-Nowara, Christopher., and John M. Nieto Philipps, editors. Interpreting Spanish Colonialism: Empires, Nations, and Legends. University of New Mexico Press,2005.

This book is a good reference to see the different how different historians both in Spain and the United States were writing about Colonial Spain. It’s an interesting trans-national look at Colonial Spain and it includes Historians from Spain, Latin America, The Caribbean, and the United States. The Historiographical analysis looks specifically at nation building and how Spain became known for being “backward” and “marginal” and how it got that reputation compared to other European countries and the United States. I think this book is a good source to show the audience how Spain was seen by the rest of Europe and why Spain is usually left out of the Enlightenment discussion when it comes to Europe.

This article is interesting because it looks at historiographical view of women and how they were operating in the Spanish Colonial era. This histography on women in the Spanish Colonial era is relatively new with a more balanced look by historians who were taking a look at the subject. The Historians looking at women began to look at women who were not in the higher class of Spanish society but were also looking at indigenous women and how they were functioning in Spanish Colonial society. I thought it was an interesting dynamic to introduce to a new reader of this specific topic to be able to include the perspective of women and to be able to see the histography and diversity of scholarship on the topic and introduce it to the reader. To be able to see how women operated in the society and how agency and see the fluidity of Women’s roles in Spanish Colonial society may have been different from other parts of Europe. 


Sources from Class. 

I think one of the ways that sources from class can be relevant or helpful on my topic of Spanish enlightenment is how we wrote and spoke on the Enlightenment era and how Eurocentric it was. I wanted to get additional perspectives from other places like Latin America and the Caribbean to be able to see how other historians that were not from Europe were writing about Spanish Enlightenment and to be able to challenge European ideas that dominated the discussion for so long. 

Another way to use the sources from class on the Enlightenment are how the separation of church and state were affecting different European states and what that meant for Spain which was not viewed as a prominent state when it came to Enlightenment thought and ideals. Spain was always shunned because of how entrenched the Catholic church was in the Country to to be able to see how the enlightenment unfolded within these parameters is another interesting reason on why to look at the Historiography of the Spanish Enlightenment.
