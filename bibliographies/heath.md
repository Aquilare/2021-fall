This source is valuable in that it describes the certain level of determinism found in Marxist history. This can be seen in its belief that various aspects of society are determined soley by the economic forces of that society. This can be seen in the belief that the government stems from the economic upper class and seeks to create laws and systems that only support or increase their level of profit. As such all social positions and beliefs are rooted in a person's position in the economic/social pyramid. Additionally, Marxists hold the belief that communism is the ultimate result of capitalism and is inevitable. This journey through economic systems would involve the lower class or proletariat rising up and taking down the upper class. This is obviously not historiography but serves to show the reasoning the beliefs held by Marxist historians.

Why Interesting: 

I believe this article does an incredible job at describing the work of Marx in a historiographical sense. It states, “he interpreted human past in a way that unfolds materialistic aspect of human nature and social conditions.” In that way we can infer that Marxist historiography was extremely materialistic and based heavily on human experience, namely that of the upper class (bourgeoisie in Marx's writings) and the lower classes. (proletariat) Furthermore, this article mentions three different “outlooks” that are held by Marxist historiography. The first being ‘anthropogenetic’ meaning that it was a way by which humans could “come to its full self-realization.” The next is ‘pragmatological’ which means “history was viewed as the result more blind than the outcome of any tendency to a specific goal or of the actions of individuals and of groups guided by their needs in the situations in which they find themselves being conditioned by historical process.” The final outlook being “nomological” meaning development was seen as akin to a natural process taking place in consonance with ‘inner hidden laws’ which is the task of historian to uncover.”

Why interesting: This article does a good job at noting the motivations and views of Marxist Historiography. It attempts to juxtapose and reconcile classic history in this article called” bourgeois history” with Marxist historiography. This comes most strongly in the form of the realization that history is often a product of the government/society that produced it. This idea is shared by both ways of viewing history. Naturally the Marxist historiography takes this stance much further than its classical counterpart by implying the relationship between the economy and class structures. Additionally, makes an interesting statement saying that Marxists are far more occupied with the present than classical historians as they continue to look for signs of a societal upheaval.
