Neville, Leonora. *Guide to Byzantine Historical Writing*. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2018.

This is a source designed to guide the reader through the histories written in the Byzantine Empire between the beginning of the 7th century up until the end of the 15th century. It explains clearly the styles of these written Greek histories, whether they be in the form of chronicles, or in other styles particular or unique to Greek or Byzantine historian in question, so as to make each history both more apprachable and more understandable to the current-day historian. Furthermore it contextualizes the written histories of the Byzantine era, to give the reader insight into what is known about each particular history which is discussed. It also acts as an introduction to the methodalogies used by Byzantine historians, so act as a training tool for historians interested in Byzantine historiography.

Lilie, Ralph-Johannes. "Reality and Invention: Reflections on Byzantine Historiography," *Dumbarton Oaks Papers* Vol. 68 (2014): 157-210

This source discusses how Byzantine historiography necessarily shapes our view of Byzantine history. This source, in its discussion of this matter, likewise touches on some of the topics and themes that have been present throughout the course of the semester, namely, the degree to which written histories reflect the "truth" and the postmodernist ideo of history as fictive constructions of the human imagination. The author comes to the conclusion that the issue of Byzantine historiography is not that it consists of purely fiction constructions of the human imagination, but rather, that it is difficult discern the true accuracy of the accounts written at this time about particular individuals or events, especially if one is not familiar with the idiosyncrasies of Byzantine historiography. As such, the author argues finally that Byzantine sources ought to be analyzed and evaluated more critically.

Treadgold, Warren. *The Early Byzantine Historians*. Basingstoke, England; New York: Palgrave Macmillan. 2007.

This source takes a look at Byzantine historiography, that is, the history of Byzantine history through the works of Byzantine historians ranging from Eusebius of Caesarea beginning in the latter half of the third century to the end of the former half of the seventh century with Theophylact Simocatta. The author discusses these historians and their talents, such as their abilities to write, think, and engage with their audiences through their personalities as conveyed through the texts of their works. Finally, the author describes how each of these indivdual historians served, through their writings, to influence the culture of the Byzantine Empire at the times which they were writing, but also how they continue to serve to shape our current-day perceptions of Byzantine history at large.

Jeffreys, Elizabeth. "The Attitudes of Byzantine Chroniclers Towards Ancient History," *Byzantion* Vol. 49 (1979): 199-238.

This source is important for my essay, as it analyzes the works of Byzantine Chroniclers in order to uncover how they had understood the ancient history which had preceded them. This being the case, it is important for the topic of historiography, as chronicling is seen in large part as a form of history writing. Despite this, much of the literature I have read differentiates chronicling and writing history as, to put it in this article's words: "Those who might be
 described as historians adopt an analytical approach in their narrative, while a chronicler lists events by years and usually in outline form only" (199). Even so, it serves to help define what a "historian" is, and by extension, what "historiography" is, by contrasting the two term and what they *are* with what they are not.

 DeVore, D. J. *Greek Historiography, Roman Society, Christian Empire: The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius of Caesarea*. UC Berkeley. 2013.
 
 This source is an absolutely essential read for the topic of Byzantine historiography, as it analyzes one of the great historians of the Greek east: Eusebius of Caesarea, and in particular, his work *Ecclesiastical History*. In so doing it serves to explore the context in which it was written, the purpose for which it was written in the first place, and the theoretical frameworks which are at the foundation of its writing. Additionally, it puts forth a thesis by which the reader is to understand this work. This thesis ultimately concludes that Eusebius, in writing *Ecclesiastical History*, blends previously existing genres of Greek historiography in order to situate Christians as having been Roman philosophers. After arguing this point, DeVore goes on to broaden his focus, in order to cover the influence that Esebius' home and status had on him, as well as to examine the place of this work as Christianity was competing with the existing paganism of the Roman world.

 Kaldellis, Anthony. *Procopius of Caesarea Tyranny, History, and Philosophy at the End of Antiquity*. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012. 
 
 This source is important as it covers the historical work of Procopius, who is considered to be one of the greatest and most important historians of the late antique period. According to the author of this book, Anthony Kaldellis, citing Edward Gibbon himself, "Procopius 'successively composed the *history*, the *panegyric*, and the *satire* of his own times.' This made him unique among ancient historians and notorious in the eyes of modern scholars" (3). This book discusses the works of Procopius as criticisms of the reign of the emperor Justinian, as well as the military histories written by Procopius about Justinian's wars, as expertly crafted narratives informed by eyewitness accounts.
 
## Source 7

Vilimonović Larisa Orlov.* Structure and Features of Anna Komnene's Alexiad: Emergence of a Personal History*. Amsterdam, Netherlands: Amsterdam University Press, 2019. 

This source is important as it analyzes an important work in the *Alexiad* covering the reign of emperor Alexios I Komnenos by his daughter, the princess Anna Komnene. As Vilimonovic describes the work in the first sentence of the introduction, it is a "masterpiece of Byzantine Historiography" (15). As such it is likewise significant as the Alexiad is a work done by a medieval woman, especially being that it is seen as so fundamental to Byzantine historiography, as most histories were written by men. This book analyzes the text, its structure, and the ways in which it was written in order to give the reader insight into how these things affect how we, as modern historians, understand the text, as well as the depth of our understandings.

## Source 8

Hioureas, Vicky. “The Portrayal of Chosroes II in George Pisides' Herakleias.” Thesis, UC Irvine, 2014. 

This work analyzes George Piside's poem *Herakelias* as a historical work documenting the emperor Herakleios' victory over the Persians and their king Chosroes II. Furthermore, it analyzes Herakleias as a literary work more broadly, as it utilizes Biblical allusions in a poteic prose in order to relay to its audience the historical narrative to the audience. In this analysis, it contrasts the Byzantine Christian view with that of the Persians. It also gives insight into how Byzantine Christians viewed their Persian rivals, as well as how they wanted the Persians to be viewed. As Hioureas states in the thesis' conclusion, "Aside from providing information about Herakleios‘ march to Persia, this poem offers a basic level of understanding about how the imperial court wanted to portray their Sasanian enemy" (19).

# How Sources From the Class are Relevant
## Classical Historiography
Classical historiography is relevant, as Christian Greek historiography is a direct descendent of classical historiography, both Roman and Greek but mostly the latter. This is because the early modern Christian historians, and for the sake of my research, the Byzantine Christian historians took the methods and style of the classical historians and "Christianized" them, that is, they had taken the classical historiographical and literary traditions and had used them for Christian ends. As such, the course *Metahistory* essays on classical historiography, as well as the class discussions and course reading reflections in the class repository on the matter are extremely relevant.

## Medieval Historiography
Sources from the class regarding medieval Christian historiography are important for one main reason: Byzantine historiography *is an example of* medieval Christian historiography. The Byzantine Empire and its Christianity are both phenomena of the early medieval world, and as such, is influenced primarily of the historical frameworks by which the (early) medieval Christian world understood the past. Furthermore, later Christian historical works, such as that of Bede, are also greatly relevant, as those works are but later developments to a process which had begun in the early medieval period of Europe.

## Early Modern Historiography
Even class sources discussing much later historiographical developments, such as Early Modern historiography, are relevant, as their contrast with medieval religious and Christian histories show how much the historical process of writing history had developed over the centuries, as it began to focus less on Christian narratives and more on human ones, aimed to be more accessible to the masses, and began to question its own purpose and utility.
