The Hitlerite "worldview" is expounded upon, insomuch as one existed. Included is the Nazi view of history, from defeat in the First World War and the propagation of the "stab in the back" myth to the view of the Jews as the ultimate driver of all things anti-German in history. Nazi historians are discussed, as well as views of the German nation prior to WWI and subsequent revisions of that history during the Weimar years and ultimately following the Nazi takeover in 1933. It covers the institutionalization of Nazi mythologies in Germany's history, as well as the Nazis' favored mode of historical propaganda: that of the new medium of filmmaking.

Like the rest of Germany under the Third Reich, the historical profession was subordinated to the will of the Nazi Party, which sought to wield history as a tool to mold a new generation of young Germans in the National Socialist image. As such, history was deemed to be of primary importance in this propagandistic venture. Ideologues like Alfred Rosenberg pushed for history education to become a form of propaganda and indoctrination. A new history curriculum was promulgated and distributed to the schools, one that emphasized race as the driving factor underlying history. Struggle between peoples and leadership were presented as what determined the fate of nations. Thus the militant spirit of National Socialism was foisted upon the schools and thereby the youth, a military character and strict regimentation based on the "Fuhrer Principle" that unsettled history teachers and made education feel like just another part of the military training regimen, which it turned out precisely to be. History education was transformed into a means to inure young Germans to the idea of battle and courage in the face of it. But it also was to instill an admiration in the youth for the Leader, as well as a virulent hatred of those deemed the enemy of the German people, specifically the Jews. This agenda was likewise extended to university education, though the more sophisticated methodologies of professional historians resisted crude Nazi attempts at assimilation. Additional chairs and institutes for military history and prehistory were founded in several universities to promote and justify Nazi ideas of racial supremacy.

The response of Germany's professional historians to the Nazi takeover was surprisingly muted in comparison to other fields of study. The traditional conservative-nationalist leanings of historians lent some amicability to the coming to power of the Nazis in 1933. Even though not a single historian was a member of the party before 1933, none left voluntarily after the takeover and there were only limited dismissals by Nazi officials. Most historians took on an affectation of "unpolitical" outward conformity while at the same time redirecting research into less controversial historical subjects, often far-removed from the present political realities. The reality was that most German historians were ok with a reorientation of history education and research into more nationalist realms. Tellingly, while some condemned acts of racial discrimination and violence as well as other social injustices perpetrated by the Nazi regime, most historians supported other government initiatives, especially those regarding territorial expansion and repudiation of the Treaty of Versailles. For these historians, patriotism was seen as inherently unpolitical, as was the belief that the First World War was not caused by Germany. Likewise, medieval Germany's eastward migration was taken for granted as an essentially "civilizing" colonization of inferior Slavic peoples. Though purporting to be "objective" investigators of history in the Rankean sense, the "objective" view of Germany aligned suspiciously with the nationalist proclivities of many historians at the time.

Professors at German universities enjoyed great prestige as well as powerful positions within the university. German universities had long had a global reputation as centers of free association and learning. Historians were in prime position for dissent as the intellectuals most aware of the connections between the state and power politics, as the academic realm of political science had not yet emerged as a separate discipline. Historians were the "custodians of the national memory," and thus their interpretation of history meant much for contemporary political ends. However, German historians were generally reluctant to voice their politics as they closely adhered to the Rankean concept of historical objectivity, which warned against transposing contemporary values onto history. As the Wiemar Republic collapsed and the Nazis came to power, historians in general were disturbed but, apart from a few cases such as Gerhard Ritter and Friedrich Meinecke, there was not any substantial public outcry.

In the early years of the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the emergence of the National Socialist movement, most historians kept their political opinions to themselves. It was generally accepted as an ethical pillar of the profession not to bring contemporary politics into their lectures and historical works. This tradition was strongly influenced by two famous German intellectuals: Leopold von Ranke and Max Weber. Ranke's concept of historical objectivity weighed heavily on German historians, who shared his conviction that the most objective and "accurate" historical works were those that did not transpose contemporary values onto times past, time which must instead be judged by their own merits. Max Weber echoed this sentiment in his 1918 lecture "Scholarship as a Profession" in which he declared "politics is out of place in the lecture room."
