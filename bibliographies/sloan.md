Historiography in the Middle Ages, edited by D.M. Deliyannis

This text goes over many different parts of medieval historiography. It separates early and later medieval time periods, but also goes over how the writing of history changed depending on the topic and location of the writer. There are sections on Dynastic history, biography, local history, and religious history, as these were all treated differently.
