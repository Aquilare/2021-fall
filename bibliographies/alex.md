**Magnusson, Sigurur Gylfi, and Istvan M. Szijarto.** What Is Microhistory?: Theory and Practice. Florence: Taylor and Francis, 2013. 

This book gives a detailed historiography of microhistory by looking at the different ways microhistory is written in Italy, Germany, and English. It also looks at getting to the to the root of microhistory. It also gives examples of famous microhistory by explaining the most well-known microhistory The Cheese and the Worms by Carlo Ginzburg and explains the benefit of microhistory. While part one of the book which is the historiography of microhistory is going to be well used part two of the book I am not as certain sense it is more of how to write a microhistory which is out of the scope of my general overview of microhistory. But part two does also give some of the issues with microhistory which will be useful for the overview. 

**Renders, Hans, Binne De Haan, and Matti Peltonen.** “What Is Micro in Microhistory?” Essay. In Theoretical Discussions of Biography: Approaches from History, Microhistory, and Life Writing, 157–78. Leiden: Brill, 2014. 

This chapter of the book is useful for a general overview of microhistory because it gets detailed into the detail of the macro- micro connection for history while also explaining what is micro about microhistory. This will be a useful to help people who get the concept of what the core of microhistory is about. And the difference between what the micro historian is trying to do which is not writing about a village history or a biography of a peasant but how a peasant’s worldview was shaped as. This chapter also tells some of the differences between microhistory and a biography because it is one of the criticisms of microhistory that they tend to not be called microhistories.

**Trivellato, Francesca.** “Is There a Future for Italian Microhistory in the Age of Global History?” California Italian Studies 2, no. 1 (2011).

This paper talks a little bit about what Italian microhistory was responding to mainly Marxist writings and about the critique of the prevailing assumptions on how pre-industrial societies functioned. And how the global change away from Eurocentric history did not have an impact on Italian microhistory. The essay also shows how the original idea of Italian microhistory has changed when taken outside of the Italian circle and has more uses to balance global history. It also gives examples of some of the new ways that microhistory can be used to tell a story about a bigger phenomenon. The paper also show how microhistory can remove the generalization of macro-analysis.
