One of the physical books I will be using as a resource. This could be likened to my foundation, as it provides a great overview of the subject matter which will not only provide an accurate timeline, but also a detailed summary of a long period of time. The span of the book is a bit more then I will need but the chapters on theory revolution and challenge to the past (as many of the thinkers I will cover believed they were doing) will provide a good basis of how the individuals who embraced the Scottish enlightenment challenged historical principles, writing, and how they believed it should carry on, moving forward. It also digs a bit into a few of the figures I will be highlighting. Namely David Hume and Adam Smith.

Touching on important figures of the period once again. This article explores a very specific idea of “resentment” in exploring history. It also takes time to explore social theory and other ideas that became prevalent for the Scottish enlightenment thinkers. The concept seems interesting as it also dives into another historical figure that is not as fleshed out in the previous book. His name was Lord Kames who seemed to center his ideas on religion and aesthetics. I’ve only read a few parts of this piece as I had to request it, and I’m waiting for it to come in.

I chose this article for a different take . We’ve often explored how many thinkers or subjects of discussion in historiography often were involved in political or economic changes. Two of the figures I’ve become most interested in are David Hume and Adam Smith who have laid some groundwork for a free market idea. The ideas they challenge and lay on the table also the idea of challenging Classical Liberalism in writing, doctrine, and formation left a mark that I’d like to explore.

**Herman, Arthur**. 2001. *How the Scots invented the Modern World: the true story of how western Europe's poorest nation created our world & everything in it.* New York: Crown Publishers.

The most interesting title of the sources I’ve found (no offense toward the others). I was actually able to pick this book up at the local bookstore. While it provides a small snapshot it does lay the groundwork for ideas, theories, and individuals who sprang up from different points in Scotland's long history. This is a fun resource, but I will most surely use it as it provides such a broad brushstroke of history in a slightly humorous way.
