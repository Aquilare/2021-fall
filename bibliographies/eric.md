Avrich, Paul. The Short Course and Soviet Historiography. Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 75, No. 4, pp. 539-553. 1960

This article gives a good overview of how Joseph Stalin created history in the Soviet Union. Stalin made sure to rewrite history to where all of it began and ended with him. His pinnacle work that was distributed throughout the Soviet Union was a textbook titled History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): Short Course. The Short Course was the defining historical text until Stalin’s death. This article his helpful because it has details about how Stalin intended for history to be written and read by the people and specifically how the Short Course came to be. The biggest downside to this article is that it does not have enough detail about if there were other historical textbooks that were allowed as companions to it or if any other history writing was allowed during this time.

Sanders, Thomas. Historiography of imperial Russia : the profession and writing of history in a multinational state. Armonk, N.Y. : M.E. Sharpe. 1999.

This book is a great overview of Imperial Russian Historiography. It has a lot of biographical information about many of the great historians in the empire but the trouble is that as an empire, there are so many historians. Some I have come across as highly important but how to choose who is the most important, will take more research. This book is really good because it has perspectives of historiography from many of the ethnicities within the empire which would have influenced there writings.

Saunders, David. The Political Ideas of Russian Historians. The Historical Journal , Sep., 1984, Vol. 27, No. 3, pp. 757-771. 1984

This article is research and rebuttal to many of the biggest named Russian historians. Saunders reviews the works of several historians from empire to the early-middle USSR and gives understanding to why and how their politics influenced their historical writing. This article will help give perspectives on why they may have written what they did. I think Saunders breaks down the time periods into more understandable categories. 

Gleason, Abbott. A Companion to Russian History. Blackwell Publishing. 2009

I am just getting started in this book but there is a great deal of information about different Russian time periods in it. When it comes to Soviet and Russian history, I found this quote to be very poignant “New information from the archives has not essentially changed the larger outlines of Soviet history, but new details abound and the Soviet borderlands have been more dramatically affected than the heartland.” This book has a more modern approach to Russian history that I have not been able to find elsewhere. The downfall is that there is only one short historiographical essay with the rest mainly being about just the history.

Mazour, Anatole.  Modern Russian Historiography.  Greenwood Press. 1975

This book may be an older, but it is about the right time period that I am writing about. It starts with the 17th century and ends with the early era of the Soviet Union. As stated in the earlier post, there have been new discoveries but not a lot has changed which is why I am comfortable with using this text. There may be some information that has changed since publication but the main ideas I need are there. The break down of periods and the defining of when “Russian Historiography Comes of Age” will be extremely helpful. I have seen several influential names appear in this text that I have seen in others which will help me focus my writing.

White, James D. Leon Trotsky and Soviet Historiography of the Russian Revolution (1918–1931). Informa UK Limited. 2021

This article is great because it is sort of about an anti-Stalin figure, Leon Trotsky, that basically setup the way the Soviet conducting history. Trotsky is responsible for how the revolution was presented to the public but this article will give that opposition view, to Stalin, of how the revolution occurred. I do not want to have a “both sides” argument but this will shed light on a major event in Russian history and historiography.

Eissenstat, Bernard W. M. N. Pokrovsky and Soviet Historiography: Some Reconsiderations. Slavic Review, Vol. 28, No. 4, pp. 604-618. 1969

This article is about one of the larger Soviet historians, Mikhail Nikolaevich Pokrovsky. Pokrovsky is a good example of how the Soviet Union loved a character but then completely despised him. He eventually made it back into good graces of the people though. Pokrovsky’s influence on Soviet history is great which is why he was blamed for a lot of things, such as the purges, since he was in charge. The downfall to this is that the article is much older so there may be some new revelations about Pokrovsky.

Enteen, George M. etc. Soviet Historians and the Study of Russian Imperialism. The Pennsylvania State University Press. 1979

This short book offers an examination of how Soviet historians wrote about the Russian Empire. There was a great deal of politics that affected the way historians wrote about the subject. In a relatively recent period after a revolution, politics is going to have a huge effect on what can be written about the past. This book has a good breakdown of the historical debate that was raging among historians of the time. Like some of my other sources, this book is older and may not have a great deal of up to date information but a solid baseline.
