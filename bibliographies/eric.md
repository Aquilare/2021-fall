Avrich, Paul. The Short Course and Soviet Historiography. Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 75, No. 4, pp. 539-553. 1960

This article gives a good overview of how Joseph Stalin created history in the Soviet Union. Stalin made sure to rewrite history to where all of it began and ended with him. His pinnacle work that was distributed throughout the Soviet Union was a textbook titled History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): Short Course. The Short Course was the defining historical text until Stalinâ€™s death. This article his helpful because it has details about how Stalin intended for history to be written and read by the people and specifically how the Short Course came to be. The biggest downside to this article is that it does not have enough detail about if there were other historical textbooks that were allowed as companions to it or if any other history writing was allowed during this time.

Sanders, Thomas. Historiography of imperial Russia : the profession and writing of history in a multinational state. Armonk, N.Y. : M.E. Sharpe. 1999.

This book is a great overview of Imperial Russian Historiography. It has a lot of biographical information about many of the great historians in the empire but the trouble is that as an empire, there are so many historians. Some I have come across as highly important but how to choose who is the most important, will take more research. This book is really good because it has perspectives of historiography from many of the ethnicities within the empire which would have influenced there writings.
