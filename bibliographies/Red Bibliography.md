Cochran, M.H. “Historiography and War Guilt.” *Political Science Quarterly* Vol. 43, No. 1 (Mar., 1928), pp. 76-89 (14 pages)

Cochran seems to really delve into the way that those in the past thought the World Wars were perpetuated and how there were many theories that, even to this day, are being discussed. He also touches upon the fact that there are so many different countries, peoples, and politics envolved in such a conversation. Each one of these groups have their own agenda, per se, about what they would like people to take from the events as histories in their respective perspectives try to piece into the causality that led to the World Wars. He gives examples like league of nations and their values, the Treaty of Versailles and the resent that it fermented in Germany, not to mention, the pacifism that Bourgeoise felt towards any escalation. Cochran also goes into how one should approach the quest in to trying to tread the topic of writing the histories of the wars, like addressing the facts as well as the generalities of the topic.
