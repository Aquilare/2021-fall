**Ramirez, Bruno. *Inside the Historical Film*. McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2014: 42-84**

I chose to use Chapter 3 from this book, titled “The Filmmaker as Occasional Historian.” For my essay, I want to focus on how the use of historical narrative in film can help or hinder the study and public knowledge of history, so this book by Bruno Ramirez is a great starting point for my research. I also wanted to know more about *who* Bruno Ramirez is, because in the chapter I am using he points out that he is a historian and a screenwriter he struggles with the “interweaving” of fact and fiction. Ramirez is a history professor at the University of Montreal and wrote some screenplays in the 80s and 90s. In the chapter itself, Ramirez brings up historians criticizing historical fiction films, using fiction to “enrich” the history, and the seriousness of research in correlation with how **truthful** a director wants their film to translate. I didn’t get too far into the book, but Ramirez also attempts to "draw filmakers into dialogue with academic historians.

**Cui, Di, Zihan Wang, and Arthur A. Raney. “Narrative Persuasion in Historical Films: Examining the Importance of Prior Knowledge, Existing Attitudes, and Culture.” *International Journal of Communication* (2017): 2741–59.**

This was another great piece I found, and although it is centered on World War II and the difference between U.S. and Chinese cultural perspective of World War II (or really any historical narrative) movies, it still highlights the issue of historical narrative in screenwriting becoming “exaggerated, distorted, or overly simplified through the writing and production process.” Cui, Wang, and Raney use the term *“narrative persuasion”* to describe the way the screenwriters (and producers) will write the history that the film is based on to basically persuade an intended audience to think differently about that history. This something we talked about in class recently, the duty of public history—and I think that this gets into that, in a way. I like (but also dislike) the term “narrative persuasion” because it can almost fall into propaganda and although propaganda can be a narrative in which historians can work through, it is a convoluted history that can hinder history.

**Abrash, Barbara, and Daniel J. Walkowitz. “Sub/Versions of History: A Meditation on Film and Historical Narrative.” History Workshop, no. 38 (1994): 203–14.**

I enjoyed this article because it encompasses a lot of what we’ve learned this semester in conjunction with what my paper is about—historical narrative and the role of the historian. Abrash and Walkowitz’s tone in this article is interesting because it is so reminiscent of Mary Fulbrook’s tone in *Historical Theory* where she, and these authors, speak directly to historians and their duty to their profession and the public. They highlight the duty of a historian to say what their view of history is in “both writing and film,” disrupting the conventional ways of *telling* about the past (I love that isn’t *talking* about the past), and how narrative strategies in film have “paralleled” historiographical developments. I also like that this article brings up the issue of agency, and how funding can have implications on production, distribution, and audience; all of which affect **content** of filmmaking, further affecting the subject of history and what gets to the public.

*I want to make sure that my paper isn't getting too broad, so if anyone sees that happening, please let me know! I appreciate any feedback!*
