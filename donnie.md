# Professed Purposes
## _Asking questions about the purpose of History_



Exploring the worth of skills developed during the active work of a Historian are debated, challenged, and redefined with each new generation. This happens as generations evolve, especially in a postmodern world. With our modern technologies and truth-seeking ways, we as a new generation of Historians have the ability and the responsibility to accurately tell and retail stories in a way that is truthful and meaningful.

In the proposed purposes of Historians to research, interpret, and tell stories of individuals and societies, it is true that specific skills are needed and honed. They create a way of looking at the world around us and recording events in a truthful way. This helps tell clear stories of who we are now. Myth Busting is a real and needed part of Historiography. With the history of professional historiography often being told from a point of view that different form many involved in the events being recorded, new historians can research and find stories that offer different points of views. 

In considering the Historiography of the dead, it is left to the living to care for the dead. Southgate argues that we as the living due this to help our own emotions of coming to term with a life that may not be remembered. Millions have been forgotten and millions more will travel this way only to never to have their story know, much more recorded and remembered. It is of some truth that remembering the dead helps those left behind. Some of the dead who have been remembered need to be so because of the good things they brought. Others must be remembered so that hopefully we will not relive the types of turmoil they brought to life. 


Transferable skills and myth busting are the skills most useful and implemented in the work of telling the stories of History. S0 then, what are the ways to use these skills productively for us now and the generations that will later read them and come to conclusions of their own based on our work?


Are we telling the stories as they really were, or are we caught up in our own beliefs? 

Are we adding too or subtracting needed knowledge? Would more research led to understanding?
