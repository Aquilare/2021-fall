What has intrigued you about history?
I've always liked studying the monarchies of the European empires and the roles these historical places played in history and how they molded the future.
Which "professed purposes" resonates most with you? An least? In both cases, explain why?
I liked the purpose of the princes and great men learning from those who resembled them by the nobleman Maiolino Bisaccini because it reminded me the ways in which 
noble man and men in positions of power would mold and shape the young kings when their father is no longer on the throne in their image as to what kind of king they wanted him to be.
The purpose that didn't make much sense to me was the puropses by the Venetian painter Titian on the Allegory of Prudence. This puropse explains how in order to construct a view or opinion on present issues and topics
you have to look back in history at how figures of the past viewed the topic or issue in order to make your own view, which I don't completley understand because I feel like the past figures opinions may help in 
forming your own opinion, its also helpful to just form an opinion on your own terms from the facts you feel are the most important.
