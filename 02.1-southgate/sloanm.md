I think what I like most about reading or researching history is that I often find that people have always been people. 
My parents are really into history, and they always like to show my sisiter and I many different cultures adn histories through books and shows. 
I'm not really interested in specific battles or things like that, as I like the more day to day things like how people cooked or made their clothes. 
I think the main reason that I'm really into history is that it's a way of connecting with people across time and space, as the more you learn about average people in different civilizations the more you are able to emphasize with them, and understand their reasons and motivations.

For the professed purposes that resonated with me the most, I have to say that I really like obligations for the dead. 
Even though these people are long gone we still take the time and effort to remember them and their lives and worlds, and almost keep them living in a way. 
I think it's important while studying history to remember that these people are not just artifacts of their time, but also living people who lived in the same world as us.
