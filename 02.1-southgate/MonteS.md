##        What is History?
        
History is Star Wars. History is Thomas Jefferson’s chickens. History is the sweeping ill-fated romance of Helen of Troy. What captured me initially was the story. A living-breathing follower of the cliche that history is a collection of stories, I found myself entranced by the **great epics** handed down from past historians and when I was younger they were packaged into blockbusters by Hollywood (Gladiator, Braveheart, ect.). These weren’t just captivating hours of entertainment but launching points for me.

I found myself wanting to know more about these fantastic characters. Why early on Richard the Lionheart might as well have been King Arthur. Alexander the Great is as fantastical as Achilles or Gilgamesh. Joan of Arc is as awe inspiring  as...*well Joan of Arc*, plenty in that story to keep you on the edge of your seat. What came later was the dive into knowledge. I didn't just wanted the characters but I was starting to want the why.

I wanted to know more about what happened to these figures, but not just the figures but what happened in the world they lived in. That soon expanded into the people around these “Great people” in history. Filled with tons of “*did you know*” and “*well actually*” an insufferable youth with a grasp on historical "facts" I found history was the subject in school I began to gravitate toward.

What I loved and still love about history is I will always learn something new. I will always be challenged with a new question. Why do I need to know this? Why did they do what they did? How does this change how I once viewed this subject? The more questions a query produced the deeper I’d want to dive into the subject. I found the listed reasons by Southland correct, all are fine reasons for someone to claim history as an important subject. I think it shows the vastness as to why so many different people delve into history. The reasons are **endless** as are the topics.

In an increasing world of “*real degrees*” pushback, which seems to echo Southland's transferable skills section on “real jobs” it’s always nice to hear the positives of studying history. However where I found myself immediately pulled was obligation to the dead. **I know!** What a strange choice. I have no doubt many will reflect on how history helps us not fall into holes of the past (well studied history, understood history) but I believe these stories need to be told. 

They inspire us, direct us, and help shape the world we live in. We of course do learn of the do’s and don'ts of past practices, institutions, and people. We also learn what came before, how this world was built, and perhaps most importantly WHY. A fan of Homer, I love the stories not just because they are fun but because they reflect human nature. What people believed, wanted, and in some ways inspired to be. So what is history? I don't believe anyone has the perfect answer, but the beautiful thing is that won't stop us from **searching** for it.
