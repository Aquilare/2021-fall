Why Interesting: 

This source is valuable in that it describes the certain level of determinism found in Marxist history. This can be seen in its belief that various aspects of society are determined soley by the economic forces of that society. This can be seen in the belief that the government stems from the economic upper class and seeks to create laws and systems that only support or increase their level of profit. As such all social positions and beliefs are rooted in a person's position in the economic/social pyramid. Additionally, Marxists hold the belief that communism is the ultimate result of capitalism and is inevitable. This journey through economic systems would involve the lower class or proletariat rising up and taking down the upper class. This is obviously not historiography but serves to show the reasoning the beliefs held by Marxist historians.

Why Interesting: 

I believe this article does an incredible job at describing the work of Marx in a historiographical sense. It states, “he interpreted human past in a way that unfolds materialistic aspect of human nature and social conditions.” In that way we can infer that Marxist historiography was extremely materialistic and based heavily on human experience, namely that of the upper class (bourgeoisie in Marx's writings) and the lower classes. (proletariat) Furthermore, this article mentions three different “outlooks” that are held by Marxist historiography. The first being ‘anthropogenetic’ meaning that it was a way by which humans could “come to its full self-realization.” The next is ‘pragmatological’ which means “history was viewed as the result more blind than the outcome of any tendency to a specific goal or of the actions of individuals and of groups guided by their needs in the situations in which they find themselves being conditioned by historical process.” The final outlook being “nomological” meaning development was seen as akin to a natural process taking place in consonance with ‘inner hidden laws’ which is the task of historian to uncover.”

Why interesting: This article does a good job at noting the motivations and views of Marxist Historiography. It attempts to juxtapose and reconcile classic history in this article called” bourgeois history” with Marxist historiography. This comes most strongly in the form of the realization that history is often a product of the government/society that produced it. This idea is shared by both ways of viewing history. Naturally the Marxist historiography takes this stance much further than its classical counterpart by implying the relationship between the economy and class structures. Additionally, makes an interesting statement saying that Marxists are far more occupied with the present than classical historians as they continue to look for signs of a societal upheaval.

Why interesting: Firstly, I believe I am slightly biased against Marxism and this article does a good job of highlighting more positive aspects of philosophy. I want to work it into the essay by putting it after claims that label Marxism as a Darwinian in origin. Kautsky, a Marxist at the time of Lenin, believed that the the social evolutionary process was invalid. The article states  “In fact, Kautsky maintained that natural and social evolutionary processes were incommensurable: “with man . .. there begins a new kind of evolution.” (Blackledge, pg 341) The article goes on to explain that the difference between natural evolution in animals and that of the slow march of society towards communism, is in fact human free will. Kautsky stated “the advance and progress of the proletariat in capitalist society is irresistible. . . . It is inevitable that the process of economic development in the direction of socialism . . . will end with the abolition of all classes.” (Blackledge, pg 342) Clearly the thought is that the social evolution towards communism requires a high degree of human agency.

Why Interesting: This article does a good job of explaining the perspective of Marxism on capitalism. “In most conceptualizations of how capitalism links Europe to non-Europe, the latter is either destroyed or incorporated, through violence and trade, into a global capitalist economy based on Europe, the power of which rests on ever more productive and exploitative capitalism, based on the extensive commodification of labor power. Those favoring destruction argue that the whole world eventually becomes capitalist, the “barbarian” having no choice but to adopt the bourgeois mode of production on pain of extinction.” (Chalcraft, pg 15) This dissects the communist manifesto and how it almost demonizes capitalist systems and pushes an almost postmodernist view that capitalism is a “conquering” system. I believe strong parallels are drawn between Eurocentric history and capitalist systems; especially in terms of syphoning resources from “less developed countries” as the article calls them.

Why interesting: This book has the history of the expansion of Marxism through various countries in the world. This will obviously be helpful for the introductory section to Marxism where I can talk about its origins and expansion. Additionally, there are valid criticisms against Marxism that are put forth, I just don’t quite know how to incorporate this without writing history as opposed to historiography. It also explains that Marxism of course has undergone changes throughout its over a hundred years of philosophical development. However, the core of Marxism continues to be the criticism of capitalism. It attacks the government heavily but proposes a “dictatorship of the proletariat” (Wang, Pg 21) This of course seems heavily hypocritical as the Marxist view of the government and their proposed replacement has been a fairly gray area.

Why Interesting: This article puts us in the perspective of Marxist historians facing out towards a world of “bourgeois” historians. I think one of the most valuable quotes comes in the form of explaining one of the core tenants of Marxism. That being a markedly critical attitude—that the "struggle with bourgeois historiography required that non-Marxist historians should be, first and foremost, "denounced" as ‘falsifiers of history’—made positive evaluation of bourgeois authors dependent on their politics and on their affinity to an orthodox materialistic understanding of history.” It also makes a very Historiographical statement saying “However, historical development is dependent on society, which tries to influence it because it needs the results of historical knowledge.” It further uses this historiographical idea to examine capitalist society.

Why Interesting: Having read the thoughts and beliefs of Marxist historiography I have seen the definitions and various thoughts of Marxist historiography, however I had never seen it in action. It can be seen the most clearly in this quote. “For the last 5,000 years, ever since the Agricultural Revolution first made possible substantial accumulations of surplus wealth, humanity has been engaged in an uneven and uncertain ascent towards the abolition of want.” This obviously has the tone of a “progressive history” in which the author places themselves at the top of the social evolutionary ladder. Furthermore, the book directly states its bias against the capitalist system going as far as to call it the “beast” that must be slayed. “To change the world, we have to understand it. To slay the beast, we need to know its nature. Capitalism today is different from the system analyzed by Marx in the mid-nineteenth century or Lenin in the early twentieth.” This book will definitely serve in a different way from the other articles in that it has to be analyzed for tone as opposed to having the tone and biases of Marxist historiography clearly laid out.

__How the Class applies to my essay:__  

I believe this historiography class has applied to my essay most broadly in the sense that it has forced me to take note of various biases and tones within essays. This needs to be applied most directly to the Faulkner book and Mogilnitsky article. This is because they are written from the point of view of extremely strong believers in Marxist Historiographical philosophy. In that way, their tone and biases need to be analyzed as opposed to the more directly concrete views of outsiders looking in on Marxist views. This can be seen in this quote: “To slay the beast, we need to know its nature. Capitalism today is different from the system analyzed by Marx in the mid-nineteenth century or Lenin in the early twentieth.” Clearly Marxist ideals are shown heavily by the tone in which this book is written. Clearly this might relay closer to the history side of the history vs historiography thought that needs to happen when writing this essay. I think I can reconcile this by talking about the tone and other aspects of Marxist writings. 

 

Structuralism will also play a large role in the discussion of Marxism could be thought of as a criticism of the capitalist structure in society. For the most part Marxist historiography attempts to view the structure of past societies and understand how capitalism has affected the writing of history. As one of the sources put it, Marxism is built on the foundation that “bourgeoise history” is nothing more than a construction of capitalist system and should thus be rejected and almost have the opposite be thought of as “history.”
