Quantitative history is not fundamentally different from ‘regular’ history because it has similarities in goals but can aggregate historical patterns on multiple levels, connecting the dots fast. Quantitative history in terms of skill or technique is applied to historical methodology by using data analysis to understand and study historical phenomena and events. This is because, as Anderson points out, “historians found that they needed to develop new technical skills and data sources because classical historical research methodology relies upon textual records, archival research and the narrative as a form of historical writing, in which the historian describes and explains particular phenomena and events, be they large epic analyses of the rise and fall of empires and nations, or the intimate biographical detail of an individual life”, which can take a life time to translate, interpret, or even find to connect these historical dots (Anderson, p1).  

The slight difference is that “a classic historical analysis, for example, may treat a presidential election as a single event, whereas quantitative historians consider a particular presidential election as one element in the universe of all presidential elections and are interested in patterns which characterize the universe or several units within it.” (Anderson, p2). To be honest this question is wonky, but I will do my best. This produces farther reaching explanations of events and phenomena, which is what we have been trying to accomplish at this point. It enables us to use historical conflicts to problem solve issues in the present and understanding the past.Although the flaw is that machines and data are do not carry human emotion so there may be conflict in that area, but is great for finding random historical information fast.
