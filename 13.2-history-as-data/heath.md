Is quantitative history fundamentally different from ‘regular’ history? 

 

I think that quantitive history is fundamentally the same as “regular history.” This is because at their core both seek to understand the past, though through different methods. Quantitive history seeks to do so through the use of math, equations and sciences while classic history seeks to understand the past through the lens of the humanities. The two are fairly similar in their goal, whoever extremely different in their application. Quantitive history takes the extremely scientific route and seeks to establish equations that should in theory be able to predict the future given past events and statistics. I think this could be extremely valuable given that it would make sense that if you took the exact same cultural, social, religious, and several other variables you would be able to repeat any event in the past. While I don’t understand how Turchin was able to quantify these variables and which variables he chose, it would in theory make sense to be able to do so. Turchin was also smart enough to mention a certain room for error in his calculations. I think this room for error is what reconciles the two different types of history. As “regular” history is considered a humanities it pertains specifically to humans and most importantly how absolutely random and unconstant we are. In that way this room for error serves to make the equation more accurate. 

 

How does this suggestion problem solving through history conflict with uses of history as we’ve seen them so far in the course? 

 

First and foremost, I would think that quantitative history promotes history as a bigger picture as opposed to individual events being separated from one another. This way of viewing history would connect every event from the past. Not only would this way of doing history involved seeing the chain of cause-and-effect relationships to result in modern times; but also seeing how different statistical trends in the population will more likely than not lead to certain events. 

 

Quantative history could also fall into the trap of starting with a conclusion and seeking to justify it after. By starting with the end product and seeking to find the variables that could explain this way of viewing history could be more prone to our own beliefs and what we think the conclusion will be. This is not to say that it is impossible to point out trends in general such as how political unrest, mass unemployment, and many other things could increase the chances of a civil war.  

 

1) Can we find every single variable that has an effect of historical events? 

2)How accurate can historical prediction be?
