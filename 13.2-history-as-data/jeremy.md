Reading Reflection

•	Is quantitative history fundamentally different from ‘regular’ history?

Quantitative  History as we saw in the article has adopted methods from social sciences and uses new technical research and different data sources that are somewhat different from “regular” Anderson gives the example of a Presidential Election where a “regular” Historian would look at this as one event on its own and a Quantitative and it looks at events as part of a pattern of other presidential elections and are organized for statistical patterns. It seems that quantitative history is focused on acquiring mathematical data and has a much more mathematical angle to compiling research and data. This task it seems to require new techniques that “regular’ historians may need to acquire to be able to practice. But on that note both quantitative history and “regular” history are similar as well in the process of collecting and analyzing data and information.

•	How does this suggestion problem solving through history conflict with uses of history as we’ve seen them so far in the course?

I think the idea of suggestive problem solving goes into direct contrast from viewing the past as it was and not trying to put a modern type of lens on it where we can try to look at the past as a problem where there is a solution or that History can be predicted as we saw earlier in the course with the cyclical nature of history from the Greek/Rome sections of the course.  As we have seen though most of the course we were looking at history and the narrative of History as it was on its own accord. By trying to fix history we are attaching a bias from the present to impose on the past and not looking at the past for what it was. 

Questions 

With Quantitative History is it really just a numbers game? Can Quantitative Historians really follow a mathematical equation or algorithm to predict past events or if they will occur in the future again kind of like  the cyclical view of History?

Is complexity science already something Professional Historians are adapting too and learning? Is complexity science only concerned with State actors and their decisions that affect other State actors? Or can it be used on a smaller level?
