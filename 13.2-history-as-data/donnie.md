# Forcasting The Future 
## _Applying Quantitative History techniques to learn our fate_


Quantitative history began as a scientific method of gathering specific and detailed information, arranged in an orderly way, thus the practice of archiving was born. This foundational move builds a base for the historiography we read and create today. 
QH can be an aspect of history, a more detailed scientific side that tells a larger story sometimes unconcerned with the type of individual history people develop. Something aside from the narrative of history, yet fundamental for the development and advancement of history.  

As quoted by Margo Anderson, Jesse Limisch speaks of this development in historic research as what makes history a bottom-up endeavor. A field of study that is oriented to the microscopic details of history in its methodology of creating the bigger picture.  In many ways, the start of research itself begins in a traceable and transparent way with QH.

Building upon this base and incorporating further scientific techniques as the early founders of Quantitative History did, historians of today advance the field of historical study into a way to predict social and cultural changes, as a meteorologist tells the forecast, a historian could predict to some accuracy social and cultural changes. 

Discerning trends, as Spinney points out became easier to follow. This would allow for greater insight into what caused the rise and fall of certain societies. Especially useful would-be combining population data with environmental data, each combined with archaeological evidence when available could lead to possible new ways of interpreting the past. 

A thought for consideration, a possible confliction between the movement of historical research and the use of QH to predict and even record history could be the overlooking of the individual once again in history. We had to struggle to get recognition for many people in the history textbooks. Grouping people together runs the risk of mass identification labels replacing individual names.
