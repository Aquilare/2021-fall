Quantitative history is different in the sense that it is more encompassing and, in a sense, scientific. As we have discussed in class, ‘regular’ history relies on historians making assertions and/or interpretations of what most likely happened in history. Quantitative history grounds its history scientifically with somewhat provable data about why certain events happened the way they did and not just supposed patterns. I do not want it to seem like I am saying that ‘regular’ historians are just making it up and quantitative are the ones telling the truth. They are both painting pictures of the past but in different ways.

Quantitative history seems to be more adjacent to the study of economics, based on my limited understanding of that discipline. The descriptions in the article sound the same because economists gather large amounts of data to describe how events have happened and the way they might happen if people and/or governments make certain decisions that have varying results on different civilizations.

The biggest conflict is that quantitative history is not “sexy”. When it comes to history, no one wants to hear boring old facts, and no one especially wants to hear about correlations in history. For example, the article posits that a rise in population played a part in certain revolutions which is good to know historically, but laypeople are not exactly interested in learning that. People want a good story and, if at all possible, they want a hero to follow and root for.

I think quantitative history will be great for sort of filling in the cracks and to answer questions that historians do not generally think to ask. Historians are not always trying to compare and contrast certain events because they are just trying to figure what happened during a single event or time period. Quantitative history will be able to tell more of the story.

I am little confused on this point, what exactly is the data they are getting because ‘regular’ history is more who did what and I cannot see how to quantify that into large datasets?

Will quantitative history become a separate field similar to public history?
