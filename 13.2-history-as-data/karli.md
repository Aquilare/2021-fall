Quantitative history is pushing the technological envelope in terms of how its methodology compares with ‘regular’ history.  This is evident by the manner in which data is considered, gathered, and used to render sets of numerical information regarding particular questions that are posed by researchers.  This is what makes it unique compared to traditional historical research, especially because these sets of data can then be used to project possible outcomes of various human events.  

So, I would argue that it is quite different from traditional history as that can be defined as the narrative of the past built on some type of theoretical framework.  Quantitative history directly contrasts traditional history because it is used to mine archival documents and historical records for numerical data instead of textual evidence of a particular event or person.

Recognizing patterns seems to be what is the overarching function of quantitative history.  The article by Laura Spinney was fascinating and I kept having to remind myself that this was written pre-pandemic.  Her discussion about Peter Turchin’s research and proposed historical theories was incredible in that he is essentially trying to predict human behavior.  This is exactly what one historian criticized in utilizing quantitative methods to predict something that is inherently irrational most of the time.

Turchin believes it is possible to draw conclusions about trends and patterns in a way that could help solve future problems.  I see the possibilities in his work, but I also wonder if things could not be more radically changed by fundamentally different events that have arisen in the last century or so.  For example, climate change and the use of advanced technologies have altered human societies in ways that it never has been previously.  I question if this can translate to recognizing patterns that are potentially disrupted and therefore are more unpredictable in their outcomes.  

Also, most traditional historians are probably unwilling to concede to this new and seemingly experimental form of historical research.  This is probably due to the fact that, mentioned above, human behavior is unpredictable, and the diverse number of theoretical frameworks used by historians to research and write about history are not all going to fit into this box of numerical analysis.  I would also argue that the use of hard data and statistical evidence is difficult to create a narrative around.  Yet, there are also great reasons to incorporate other disciplines (like mathematical and statistical analysis) into the field of history which would allow for further diversification.

*Questions:*

How would interdisciplinary history be perceived by postmodernists?

Does using data and pattern recognition make historical information more accurate?
