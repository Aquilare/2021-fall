# Piecing History Together 


Fulbrook takes exception with the possibility that the narrative of historiography is dead but does feel that the one true account of history told in a Metanarrative of single perception is no longer a viable way to view history. She believes evidence is not as empirical as once thought when it comes to piecing together the actual events of the past, the notion of not being able to tell any story at all is inaccurate.  In fact, with accepting that competing theories could live side by side we can create a clearer picture of the past. We can still piece together a story and compare each to the other to from an overarching larger narrative or Metanarrative. This one not being from one point of view that points to another, but rather the diligent pursuit of individual possibilities that with careful comparison could led to a better understanding of events gone by. 

It seems the concern Fulbrook has with Jenkins is his willingness to give up finding facts within history and comparing the study of history to creative writing designed to help the current population. This being Jenkins’ response to postmodernism.

While the dismissing of a nineteenth and twentieth century historical metanarrative can move historiography forward. This is the point in the necessary death of metanarratives and the birth of perspective. It is not the molding of history to suit the needs of today. The refusal of all stories, as Jenkins would prefer, is missing the point of story within history.  

Hans Kellner’s view of history, “history is not about the past as such, but rather about our ways of crating meanings from the scattered, and profoundly meaningless debris we find around us.” Fulbrook on the other hand wants to find the meanings in all these pieces of scattered history and place them together for a true metanarrative. However, this time it’ll be much different than the ones before as it will come together as pieces that together create a whole, cohesive narrative. 





- Will we gain better clarity by adding additional stories to history or are we only entertaining our present curiosities? 
- Between little fact and big imagination, is there a middle ground of truth to be found?
