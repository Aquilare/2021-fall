Metanarrative, to Fulbrook, is the *Great Story* that has been told about history. Essentially she writes that this is the ‘grand narrative’ that is operating within a ‘broader philosophical framework” (p. 58).  This approach to historical research, more broadly, is essentially dead because of the splintered and various ways in which to formulate historical questions and topics.  This is then manifested in the ways in which historical theory has developed since postmodernism, which introduced the ideas of competing and, therefore, conflicting narratives and historical accounts.  

**One great overarching narrative is no longer an acceptable basis for historical theory.**  This matters greatly because there is now a spectrum of historical theorists operating in either extreme in regard to narrative history; either it is the absolute and only accurate format in which to relate “things as they were”, or because history is all literary and therefore it is an invention of human creativity and history as a subject of inquiry is ultimately useless (so why bother).

Fulbrook squashes the claims by Jenkins that history might as well be forgotten and relegated to “ample imaginaries provided by the postmodernist type theorists” (p. 57), and does so by siding with White.  They both posit that *historical narratives can be approached with meaningful connections to other historical theories and ideas*, even if these connections are individualized.  These connections can be made in a framework (paradigm) that holds certain “facts” in common with one another, and therefore can constitute another form of narrative that is based on largely agreed upon ideas and known information.

Because of the nature of paradigms and governing frameworks in which historical theories are predicated on, there is huge amount of sorting out of information.  I like that Fulbrook likens this to puzzle solving because it actually feels like attempting to put together a huge jigsaw puzzle.  You open a box (the archives, records or other sources) and dump it all out on the table and start sorting through “the debris” to find the relevant pieces that fit together.

Fulbrook is trying to solve the conundrum of how to approach differing paradigms and historical theories, along with the frameworks or narrative structures, in a way that can be complementary to one another.  I think her overall goal of the entire book is in trying to breach the divides (sort out the puzzle pieces) between all of the competing ideas in order to at least allow for some critical analysis by historians.  Ultimately, this may help individuals determine their own theories and approaches while remaining aware of the various approaches there are to “doing” history.

*Questions For Thought:*

What are other methods of rendering historical research publicly (not including chronicles and annals)?

Should historical narratives be completely factually based?  If they are not, does this mean historians should be discounted as unacademic and therefore writers of fiction?
