Reading reflection

•	Regarding the “death of metanarrative”: What does Fulbrook mean by metanarrative? Why is it dead? Why does it matter?

What Fulbrook means by the metanarrative or “grand narrative”: that is, of histories that claim to encompass and tell the story of the great unfolding pattern of the past in the light of some greater metanarrative, so broader philosophical framework.” (58) The metanarrative is what we have been looking at throughout the course from the cyclical histories to the linear perception of time. Metanarratives have shown change through time and also had the belief that we were making progress as more time unfolded. 
Fulbrook explains that the death of the metanarrative is the rejection of the belief of one master narrative that is unfolding throughout human existence. Fulbrook goes into a long explanation of the Marxist theory of metanarrative where she goes throughout the economic aspects of the Marxism metanarrative and how Marx was really hazy about how the end point would function and how it’s easy to get pulled into over arching narratives. 
I think that Fullbrook thought that the idea that the metanarrative was dead matters because when we aren’t confined to the idea of narratives that are taking us to a specific place or the idea that history is unfolding in a certain way we can look more critically and carefully at what is happening without the confines of the metanarrative.

•	Why does Fulbrook disagree with Jenkins? How does she refute his claim that history is essentially fiction?
Fullbrook strongly disagrees with Jenkins because Jenkins makes the claim “anyone can have a history to suit themselves, anyone and anything and thus everything is permitted.” (57) Fullbrook sees this interpretation of History as careless and irresponsible and she also went on to say “that is to engage in a reasoned inquiry into the character of certain aspects of the past, to seek to explain how selected elements or strands changed in the ways in which they did and not in other directions, and to attempt, with as much intelligence, imagination and discipline as can be mustered, to bring some sense of all this back to the present in order to satisfy the curiosities of today. (57) 

Fulbrook says that historians are really just trying to solve puzzles. What puzzle is she trying to solve?

Fullbrook states “In short, historians work within collective traditions of inquiry which set certain parameters and puzzles for which they seek solutions.” (67) Historians don’t start out from a blank canvass Fullbrook goes on to say historians have to work with what is presented to them and have to consider certain parameters in order to solve these puzzles that has presented to them. Fullbrook later states that “A great deal of history is, thus, not so much about individual historians “emplotting” the past out of the blue, as it were, but rather about puzzle solving within the context of particular controversies or wider frameworks of investigations.” (67) Fullbrook I think is trying to untangle the past and look at it without or form a different perspective of the classic metanarratives. These grand or meta narratives can be confining or limited in being able to put the puzzle pieces together I think is what Fullbrook was trying to address. 

Questions.

Are metanarratives more undead than dead? I mean are metanarratives more zombie in that they seem to be partially dead but somewhat alive? 

Could we use certain pieces of different metanarratives and fashion them together with other narratives to create a Frankenstein like narrative that could be seen as useable for historians?
