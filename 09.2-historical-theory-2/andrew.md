# Reflections on Fulbrook, Historical Theory II

We’ve talked a lot about metanarratives in this class so far, and like many of the postmodernist thinkers we’ve recently been exposed to, Fulbrook seems to concur that there is no single “real” grand story that encompasses all history. However, I found her points on the postmodern reaction to the death of master narratives quite interesting. On Monday, we talked about how metanarratives have a very specific teleological approach to writing history, namely that empiricists tend to impose a purpose onto history by using past events to construct a narrative (Fulbrook calls this _“emplotment”_). 

However, in Chapter 4, Fulbrook gives us some insight into the reinvention of metanarrative-style historiography by postmodernist thinkers. For instance, she notes how modern secular thinks describe patterns of development, such as industrialization or urbanization, in a similar manner to how early modern and enlightenment thinkers described the notion of progress. Similarly, some postmodernist historiography takes up the task of lending a voice to marginalized groups who’ve been silenced in the past, constructing a kind of underdog narrative that still suits a particular purpose. So interestingly, the widespread death of metanarrative has resulted in competing _“selective major narratives”_

The difficulty that naturally arises from this, as we discussed on Monday, is the trouble of squaring competing narratives. Fulbrook refutes Keith Jenkin’s heavily postmodernist approach through highlighting that, while we may not have unmediated access to the past, we can work within established frameworks of thought to synthesize historical knowledge and thus foster a working understanding of the past. 

I found her critique of Hayden White much more interesting though. White posisted that history is akin to literature in that its products are essentially _disconfirmable_ ( it took me a moment to unravel that double negative in my head). However, Fulbrook points out that White’s theory of disconfirmability is predicated on the idea that relationships between historical events exist only within the mind of the historian – an interesting, if patently absurd, notion. This would imply that it is impossible for historians to discover any casual relationships between past events, and would subsequently imply that all interpretations of how history happened are equally valid. Fulbrook, and I for that matter, disagree with this conception of historical knowledge. Unlike literature, which is fully the product of an authors creative faculties, the practice of history is equal parts theoretical and based in tangle reality.

Now, while we may only have leftovers of that tangible reality in form of imperfect archives, we can use our theoretical framework to interrogate those archives and seek to uncover a more representative image of the past. Far from simply discovering what she calls _“historical debris”_ and subsequently crafting a narrative from nothing, _Fulbrook asserts that historians are really puzzle-solvers, working together within an intellectual framework to probe the past, not invent it._
