I apologize for my ignorance, but I feel that a metanarrative is closer to a high school or lower division survey course where a student is only taught the most basic history with no deep dives into one particular area. I think I might not be pushing past my own definition when trying to understand how others, like Fullbrook, define what they mean when they say metanarrative.

The metanarrative is dead because there are too many voices to drown out the overall ability to have one grand story that towers above the rest. We have spoken about this in class, that it is not a bad thing that more people are joining to tell their story, but it breaks down the ability for one story to be had about a subject because everyone is searching for their answer to a question. 

The death of the metanarrative matters because metanarratives gave a sort of illusion that there was only one overarching story to history but now everyone has a story so who is going to care or even understand history when there is an abundance of ideas about what might of happened in the past.

Fullbrook disagrees with Jenkins because he believes that there is not point in trying to historicize the past. If I am reading it right, Fullbrook refutes Jenkinsâ€™s ideas with the theory that historians can know the past through their empiric standards. Fullbrook posits that history can be known through educated guesses. She calls them puzzles but that is what they are and that is not a bad thing. Historians are just trying to make the best guesses of what happened through the evidence. 

I think the puzzle Fullbrook is trying to solve is the puzzle of history. It sounds obvious but how does one make history relevant when people in her own field feel that they are just story tellers that are possibly making things up? Fullbrook is trying to bridge the gap of how to make history a relevant pursuit with the extreme postmodern idea that, in a sense, nothing matters because everything matters.

Are smaller metanarratives not just an area of specialization like certain cultural studies?
