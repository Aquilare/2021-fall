### Historical Theroy 2
To me Fulbrook means the major underlying principle of how historians write history. An example would be the idea of humans having progressed from one state to a “better” state. The metanarrative died because of emergence of multiple different narratives and that they did not conform to the grand picture of history and because of premodernism extreme view that history is nothing but fiction. This matters because the death of metanarratives brings in the question of the meaning of history and the historian’s job. That with out this narrative everything is just fragments of documents strung together to make a narrative and does not show the past for how it “really was”. 

Fulbrook disagrees with Jenkins because for the easy answer its anti-historic. And that for the most part if you really analyze the metanarratives, you can get down to specific propositions that you can further look into and also find out that some of the specifics in the narrative are not always a historical look or help the historian at all. That these metanarratives you can try to see they are about real relationships and trends in history which Fulbrook believes are a crucial part to the issues of the nature of history augments.

The puzzle I believe Fulbrook is trying to solve is how can figure out which of the metanarratives is the “best” options out of all the competing metanarratives that are around for a topic. Not to say that there is only one but to weed out the less persuasive telling of events. she is also looking into how these frameworks of assumptions are developed and how the collective frameworks change how a historian conducts their inquiry into the subject that they are looking at. That there is more of a complex situation happening than just literary and cultural narratives happening. 







### Questions 
Are metanarratives dead or have they changed and taken on a new form?

How can dissecting a metanarrative help a historian find new questions to ask about the past?
