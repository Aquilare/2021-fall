## Beyond Metanarrative
In chapter four of *Historical Theory*, Mary Fulbrook discusses in part the establishment, but primarily the breaking down or **death of metanarrative**, as well as acting as a proponent for practicing history like putting together the pieces of a puzzle. 

Fulbrook describes the historical metanarrative as essentially History with a capital H. "**The** story of **the** great unfolding pattern of the past"(58). Metanarratives, from my understanding of it, seems to be the collective knowledge and understanding of what is left following a fundamental paradigm shift. An overarching framework that historians can place upon moments in time in which to analyze them. 

Fulbrook argues that it is significantly more complicated than just getting rid of these big picture narratives, though they might be problematic, or compete with one another, and that some can even be helpful frameworks in which to understand, or even potentially "solve" the historical puzzle.

Throughout the book, and more specifically throughout this chapter, Fulbrook comes back to certain concepts of the argument of historical practice as art vs. science, empiricism vs. literary devices, modernist vs. postmodernist thinking. One partiularly interesting topic was her account of, and overall disagreement with Keith Jenkins strong ideas that due to the fact that there are so many possibilities, history is characteristically worthless. Like Fulbrook, I also disagree with him, but I find it fascinating and confusing that a person could come to that conclusion. 

Learning of Jenkins point of view immediately made me think of two things. First, it brought me back to one of our early classes in which we discussed the Greeks' views of history and their historiography. There are some dramatically fatalistic parallels in the two historical opinions, and despite having been concocted as historical thought millenia apart, there is clearly a shared thread. 

Second, Jenkins argument is a weird postmodernist dichotomy. His own theory clearly falls into a postmodern box, and yet he is somehow arguing both for and against the fractured nature of postmmodern historiography, as Fulbrook references in this chapter. 
> I mean, why bother historicising the past anymore? Thus it will be my argument here that we might as well forget history and live in the ample imaginaries provided by postmodern type theorists. 

Fulbrook shoots down Jenkins' argument in the same way that she questions Hans Kellner's, by bringing forward the concept of history being a puzzle that must be pieced together rather than constructed or fabricated entirely, or even partially, from our imaginations.

A question:
Is it possible to have a "death of metanarrative"? Or will one just replace the other as it tends to do with paradigmatic shifts?
