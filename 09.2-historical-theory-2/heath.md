And I thought this class was abstract and depressing before..... 

 

In her writings Fullbrook’s description of metanarrative is extremely different from that of many other historians which leads to her concept of the “death of metanarrative.” Through definition via differentiation, we can see that Fullbrook’s metanarrative is far less extreme than that of other historians such as Hayden White. In White’s writings he equates history to nothing more than literary fiction as humans have the inability to remove emotion and our need for story from any writing. This can be called the “Pacifist Metanarrative” in which history is nothing more than “a complex of symbols and icons in literary tradition.” This belief leads to the death of metanarrative in that it completely removes the validity of any form of history.  Afterall, how can history be considered a science if it is nothing more than literary structure, with little to no actual fact. If there is no real fact within our history, is there actually a point in studying it? In that way the very nature of metanarrative leads to its own downfall. 

 

Fullbrook disagrees with Jenkins in his extreme generalization in his claims about the purpose and viability of history. Furthermore, he goes as far as positing the question of “why bother with history?” Jenkins denies the existence of an overarching metahistory that can account for history as a whole and thus believes that there is no true point to history. Fullbrook denies this by asserting that there are many smaller, partial metahistories that can at least account for parts of history. The major examples given are that of Judo-Christian values in which the world becomes better than it was as time passes, linking this to ideas such as nationalism, manifest destiny, and even Marxism. If there truly are elements of advancement in history there are clearly ways to analyze. Furthermore, if there are indeed ways to analyze and characterize history there is a purpose in the understanding of it.  

 

I might be a little off as well as slightly reductionist in saying this however, Fullbrooks responds to Jenkins by arguing that if history is a noun and we have the ability to give it adjectives, there is indeed a way to understand its “truth” and therefore give it a purpose.  

 

In using the term “puzzle solving” Fullbrook walks the middle ground between the extremism of the far removed, abstract post modernism and relatively romantic ideals. She argues that while there might not be any large overarching truths when it comes to every single paradigm and lens of history; there are however truths within a single framework or lens. In that way we solve the puzzle by having a starting point of our lens and then searching for the facts that would allow us to better understand it and answer our questions. In that way she has a relatively romantic view in seeking a purpose for history while also admitting its ultimate futility. 

1) Can there ever be any actual “Truths” when surely none work for every paradigm and lens through which to view history? 

 

2) Is there an actual way to deem either Fullbrook or Jenkins correct?
