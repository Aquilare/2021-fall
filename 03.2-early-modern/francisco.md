What would you consider the key developments in Renaissance history writing?
I like how the author states that Jean Bodin, Francis Bacon and John Slden had different ways of growth. The author also states that the Renaissance was a time of change by writings by varis historians. Also I find that the author also states his opinion saying that the Renaissance was the greater interest in the history of Greek and Roman times to explain things. 
In the chapter, it says that there is concern about the past history. Also it says that the medieval historians showed less interest in explaining things, it was  more a general view like talking about God and other ways. Some of these historians wrote in secular views which was intrateing because during this time , God was very important to many people. Some writings that were written to a degree were controversial. The scientific revolution played a very important part in this time for everybody because in the text the author states that Bacon was different and caused some trouble for the control of church and god. I see the author puts this in to show what could have happened. Also Bacon and Boldin were better known for their science knowledge. I like how this is put in the chapter to show that they were very important as histars but better in the scientific  role. I like the specartion aspect she writes. Only some historys challenged religion and it was there for the reader to understand better that not all historians were not all against organized religion. 

The hereditary principles played a very important role to find out how  history is being used in Renaissance Europe. These short stories have government but to lim,ete degree that is not the way of life. In the stories the mixed principals, the author says this is that men willingly change their masters in the belief that they will fare better. 
These two readings were very integrating because of some very important views that the authors wrote and what the historians say of these writings. I like how they add more information and the facts that were not important to this topic but we do not need that history sometimes.
