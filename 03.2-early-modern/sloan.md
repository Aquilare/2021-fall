  Writers during the Renaissance were more focused on humanist and secular topics than their predecessors.
Renaissance writing also seemed to have lots of political motivations and purposes.
While there have always been political pieces written throughout history, the Renaissance era goes much more in-depth about how and why certain people came into power, tracing back certain consequences that led to them.
I think a key development in this writing is that there was also a lot more ability to be critical of the Catholic Church and their practices, and history writing has a whole seems to hav etaken a less religious focus on events.
I think this period also brought more analysis, in terms of what historical events led to their contemporary world.

  I think that The Prince really shows how history and politics had become intertwined. Machiavelli says in his writings that an established prince will have little trouble keeping his land, because he family has been there a long time and people have already accepted it.
The past is a way for a ruler to establish himself in a city, whether that city is used to having a ruler or not. 
Machiavelli also uses many examples of past conquerors, citing their good and bad choices as something to either emulate or avoid. 
He brings up how the Romans were able to conquer many lands and what they did to keep power there without increasing their troubles. 
The Prince really shows how people thought and practices about their governments was changing, especially in Florence. It wasn't necessarily just divine rule, and princes were expected to be politically savvy and know how to keep their power.

Questions
1. How many people not only read The Prince, but followed it's advice, and how did that affect their rule?
2. How quickly did the style of writing change to this way?
