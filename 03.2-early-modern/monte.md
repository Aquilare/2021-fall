# Early Modern History


With the emergence of the Renaissance we see the study of history separating from a more structured narrative. This period we begin to see a challenge against the two main pillars of the medieval period, that being the **Catholic church** and the **Feudal system.**

The progression of writing from the periods thus far loosely followed a system. Antiquity and history was constructed or determined by the gods. In the medieval period history was a tapestry from God. In the Renaissance we begin to see historians focus on the decisions of men. How they changed history, or affected history.

It’s also not a Renaissance or enlightenment if you don’t have something to light up. In this case it was the poor middle ages. Or as the self proclaimed enlightened ones might call it the “dark ages”. The major goal was to depart from the ignored middle child who focused heavily on the church. They wanted to return to pick up the torch from antiquity.

As described in Eileen Ka-May Cheng’s *Historiography* this didn’t mean that they wanted to return to ancient times. They were taking what the Greeks and Romans did and were going to do it better. We do see a reflection of comparing modern history for the Renaissance period with history of the Greeks and Romans. How they could be mirrored with modern history became a popular attraction.

This is very noticeable in the excerpt from Machiavelli. The focus on how history can be used either good or bad in a modern sense shows the push to make history applicable to the now. Machiavelli had an idea of how history can be used in a sense of political power. Which despite it’s cutthroat nature remains a popular way to devour history. A modern reflection can be seen in the book “*48 Laws of Power*" which uses history in a similar fashion.


Questions
1. How do these more human focused thinkers feel about other religions, with the major break from the organized central church starting?
2. Will people look back at this point in history and see it as a golden age or a "middle age"?
