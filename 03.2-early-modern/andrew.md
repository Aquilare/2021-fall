## Cheng and Machiavelli Reading Reflection 

Hi everyone, 

In a word, I’d characterize the writing of history during the Renaissance as humanist. This is to say that during the Renaissance, historiography started to become more secular and systematic. As a result of the shift in focus from divine will to human action, history also began to be implemented in more pragmatic ways.

To begin with, Renaissance historians were far more willing to challenge the word of the Church than their medieval counterparts. It’s during the Renaissance that we begin to see historians take up the task of myth-braking, especially as it relates to religiously justified historical myths. This is most clearly exhibited, I think, in Jean Bodin’s efforts to debunk the theory of the four empires and the idea of a golden age. Both of these notions found legitimacy in the Christian Bible, specifically in a prophecy in the Book of Daniel that established the world would see four great empires, starting with Babylon and ending with Rome. Bodin pointed out that the world had seen many more than just four empires, and he ridiculed the idea that past ages were inherently greater than the present age, and in both instances he used material developments in human history to prove his point. By exposing how these biblically based theories were not historically sound, Bodin undermined the authority of the Bible as a historical source, and in doing so helped to construct a view of history based more on human action than divine will.

Due in large part to the influence of people like Bodin, historiography began to become more systematic during the Renaissance. In contrast to the traditionally held view that history is akin to an art and thus ought to be grouped in with literature and rhetoric, Renaissance intellectuals like Frances Bacon encouraged a more scientific application of history. Bacon emphasized the need for a more objective account of history absent of judgement. Relating the work of a historian to that of a scientist, Bacon noted how the first duty of a historian ought to be to report facts as they are instead of imposing broader theories onto existing facts. Furthermore, Bacon encouraged historians to seek validation for their theories by examining writings contemporaneous with the time they were writing about, as opposed to appealing to other historians as a means of proving one’s point. While Cheng notes that Bacon himself was not entirely faithful to the new code of historiographical ethics he prescribed, his efforts at making the writing of history more scientific and empirical nevertheless illustrate the changes to historical methodology that took place during this time period. 

Lastly, the use of historiography during the Renaissance became far more pragmatic, which is to say that historiographers attempted to learn from history to determine the most optimal course of action going forward. This is best illustrated in the work of Italian historians Francesco Guicciardini and Niccolo Machiavelli, both of whom examined history to find explanations for past political and military developments. While Guicciardini was more concerned with studying individuals in power and Machiavelli more concerned with broader secular forces like Fortune, both looked to the past for lessons on how to proceed in the future (though Guicciardini was far more cautious and warned against the tendency to derive lessons from dissimilar past events). Throughout his most famous work, The Prince, Machiavelli repeatedly mentions past historical figures, including Alexander the Great, King Louis of France, and Cesare Borgia (any Assassins Creed fans here?), and elucidates their tactical triumphs and failures, whether military or political. The Prince is essentially a manual to political and military dominance written for Lorenzo de' Medici, so it should come as no surprise that when Machiavelli appeals the history of past leaders, it is for the purpose of guiding Medici in the right direction going forward. 

1 – Is the challenge to religious authority that came with Renaissance historiography indicative of a higher degree of tolerance towards new ways of thinking and modes of expression? How does this impact future eras of history? 

2 - By what criteria should one classify "golden" or "dark" ages of history? How does our interpretation of these ages shape the way we think about the present? Should we even have such classifications at all? 

Thanks,
