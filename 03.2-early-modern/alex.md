### Writing History
The writing of Renaissance history goes through many changes during the time period. But overall, I would say that writing history in the Renaissance was divided from what I would call the traditionalist and the humanist and then the divide in the humanist camp on the question of is History an Art or Science. The traditionalist would be the ones that I would say still hung on to the old medieval thinking of history. The Humanist on the other hand thought of history in terms of human involvement to what had happened in the past.. 
 
### Key Developments
The first big change to how history was written was the how renaissance writers could benefit the present by learning about the Romans their willingness to challenge the church. This helped change the way history was written because the Renaissance historians putting a greater focus on historical explanation in terms of human activity and not the will of God. 

The second major change that occurred was the thinking that history was a science and that it should be looked at with empirical analysis of events that occurred in the past. This means that historians started to be more critical in the sources that they used which as the Eileen Ka-May Cheng put forth had help roots outside of History. This major change can be seen with Bodin belief that a historian should understand history in the realm of humans and not divine intervention. 

Now with the thinking of history as more secular than in the past does not mean that there were not people who wrote in a secular nature but put things in a religious twist like Bradford.
### *The Prince*
The excerpt from The Prince is showing the change that the past can teach the people in political power lessons on how to rule or take over an area from mistakes from kingdoms that tried to take over parts of Italy in the past and give an explanation on why it failed by comparing those events to how the Romans controlled and ruled the area. 

This helps show the influence on looking back on the Romans as the Golden era and wanting to bring lessons to help the ruling class to stay in power.
 
### Questions
Do you think the treat of the Catholic Church hindered the historians of Renaissance Europe from giving their full thoughts on history?

Where would you place History? As a Science or an Art?
