Historical writing during the Renaissance can be characterized by the beginnings of a separation of religious elements from a secular history. For much of the histories written in Christian Europe up to the Renaissance were written with a bent and favor towards the Christian religion, especially the Catholic Church. 

The rise of Protestantism allowed for people to question the Catholic Church in all aspects of life including in writing history. Historians were starting to rewrite or reinterpret history without the Church’s influence. I would not say they were not fearful of reprisals from the Church but they were able to be more bold in their taking out the religious elements on history and they were able to make the Church look like the bad guys. 

One aspect I appreciated was that historians were using more modern and scientific approaches to understand history that made the Church look bad without trying. They were in essence recording and reporting the truth, mostly, and it showed how the Catholic Church could be the bad guy throughout history. 

I do not mean to sound like a religion hater but it is important to see the beginnings of the somewhat true historical writings. Standing up to religion was just the first step in being able to write a “true” history without religious influence.

I believe Machiavelli is using the more human approach to understanding history. He can see that human actions can influence events and this understanding makes it easier to put into context why states could be conquered and held more easily than others. His humanist approach is an attempt to highlight how “fickle” humans can be.

Were non Christians changing their styles of history during this time? 

Alternatively, were they able to get away with sort of bashing the Catholic Church in Europe with their histories?
