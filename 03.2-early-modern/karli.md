With the rise in influential cultural movements, such as Humanism, the Renaissance took new approaches to the study of history overall.  There are several Early Modern thinkers of the period mentioned in the chapter from Cheng’s book, all of whom formed some of the diverging schools of thought on how history was studied and written.  

The basic topics of Renaissance historical studies include matters related to the state (militarily and politically), religious viewpoints, advances in scientific thought and reason, and the early blending of related academic disciplines.

Of the **most important** of those changes in historical approach are those regarding religion and the critical analysis of sources.  Tied directly to the ideals of Humanistic interpretation, the secular view of human events led to new definitions of what progress might mean, separate from the interference or interventions of the divine.  Secular viewpoints allowed for (and perhaps aided in promoting) human agency during a time of cultural upheaval.  

This new assessment of history may have led (in part) to the Reformation and the overall impacts it had on socio-cultural organizations in the West.  Man was now seen as responsible for the events that took place around him and the analysis of these events became a source of critical thought.

Antiquarians and scholars along with their ability to collect and analyze primary sources are *extremely crucial* in establishing our own modern interpretation of how history is currently studied.  Looking at first-hand accounts of events and biographical information about figures from history allowed for many varying viewpoints to be considered and critiqued.  

Take for example the historical writings of William Bradford as noted by Cheng. Although he had a clear agenda in the overtly religious tone of his historical topics, he also included the letters and writings of his contemporaries who either agreed with or opposed his own theologies in an effort to allow his readers to form their own opinions about his work.

Machiavelli’s use of parallel historic viewpoints between those military and political events of antiquity and the events that took place within his own lifetime set the standards for historical writings of his time.  Relating the actions and strategies of ancient Romans and figures like Alexander the Great to the behaviors of various rulers of Early Modern Europe allows for Machiavelli to point to good or terrible political strategies.  

He uses specific examples of political and military events to illustrate what a good or feared leader (The Prince) should or should not do.  Essentially, this gives his opinions more merit as his advice is based on the outcomes of these past events.  This further shows the changing nature of how Early Modern historic ideals were being reshaped by the cultural preferences of scholars and thinkers of the period.  	

*Further Questions for Thought:*

Are there other cultural preferences and philosophies of the Renaissance that shaped Early Modern historical studies besides Humanism?

How did colonization and the “newness” of the Americas lead to the change in Europe’s own view of its historical “supremacy” in global affairs?
