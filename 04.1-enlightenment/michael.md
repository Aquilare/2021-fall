## Enlightenment Historiography Reading Reflection

The enlightenment was, as the chapter points out, a set of intellectual movements (as opposed to one singular movement) that emphasized the use of human rationality in order to come to conclusions about various questions or issues rather than to simply accept the word of authorities or the "status quo" answers on the matter. As Kant put it, enlightenment is "man's release from his self-imposed tutelage". That is to say, that humanity brought upon itself answers to important questions, and is entlightened by "releasing" itself from such answers by questioning them.

Enlightenment thinking got applied to the reading and writing of history by, for example as was done by Voltaire, shifting its focus from political and/or military affairs and events, to the criticism of social institutions, habits and customs. Additionally, Enlightenment historiography operated from a **secular framwork**, that is, it was not written in the context of religion, nor was it written with the intention that it be interpreted in religious terms. Finally, Enlightenment historiography was no longer seen as a creative or artistic exercise, but rather, was now more considered to be science or an empirical inquiry into the realm of facts.

Despite this, historiography during the enlightenment was used for different ends. As was already mentioned Voltaire used history for the sake of social criticism. 

Others, such as those subscribed to the **stadial theory** of the Scottish enlightenment, used historiography to define history as a progression humanity via four stages (the hunter, pastoral, agricultural and commercial; all based on their respective **modes of subsistence**) with each stage being more "civilized" than the last. 

Another approach was that of Edward Gibbon, who used historiography in an attempt to create a coherent narrative of history in order to make generalizations of it. He later abandoned this approach as he came to recognize a greater diversity in historical events which his initial assuptions did not allow for. 

Around the same time, American historians used historiography to justify their revolution against the British Crown and set themselves apart from their former masters.

The main commonality between all of these different approaches to history and historiography is that they were all done for particular purposes or goals. None of these approaches were done merely for the sake of revising how historigraphy was being done, but to make and defend arguments or answers about or to various questions and issues. 

Likewise, the biggest difference involves the questions and issues, but more specifically their natures. The goals of each approach were rather wide ranging, from criticizing the institutions of the time, to things such as determining the natures of human social development and history itself, as well as justifying a certain act of rebellion against an establish authority.
