The new idea that spread among Enlightenment history was looking at different histories not just the major political aspect of the Renaissance thought on history. The other aspect was a bigger separation of church and history and that the continuation of making History more of a science. They did this by a focus of using and citing sources and defending the validity of the sources that they are using.

The other thing that was new was the belief of Human progression that history and society has progressed and that humans have progressed throughout time and there was not a golden age, but humans have constantly progressed. They did this by looking at bigger regions like trying to write a unifying history as a region and not individual countries.

### Applied history

The way that enlightened historians wrote was a social purpose. This was one of the reasons why enlightened thinkers where thought as anti-historical because they measured the past in terms of their own time and not one of the time periods that they are looking at. Another thing was that at this time history was being more of a Eurocentric in nature.

### Chapter

The commonality between the thinkers that the chapter had put forward was their “attack” on the church. The other major commonality was the looking at different histories, Voltaire looking at the social and cultural life. While Robertson followed the four-stage theory and made commerce the mode of change.

The differences between the historians are that they had different ways they perceive the same points. Robertson with the four-stage theory he had to use more conjecture and added his own beliefs to the gaps in the historical writing. Robertson cited much more than Voltaire did and criticized him for the way Voltaire cited. He also thought of commerce being the civilizing force. An example is Robertson views on the Natives Americans where they are backwards from Europe but there in a more primitive stage of development. 

Gibbon difference was that he combined secular and philosophical history together like in his reasoning for the fall of Rome being a combination of factors for its fall.

Webber was the most different from the others is because of how the revolutionary historians challenge to the monarchy and that they used history to justify the revolution and define America.
