  Enlightenment thinking was much more focused on reason than it's predecessors, and this changed the way that people wrote and researched things like history.
The Enlightenment way of thiking moved from only being about large events involving kings and nations, to smaller events involving social and artistic histories. 
They were also much more secular in their writings, and they broke away from more traditional ways of writing and thinking about history and the world in general.

  The way of Enlightenment thinking was more secular than it's predecessors, and this was applied to their way of writing history as well. 
They also beleived that the study of history could be used to improve the people of today. 
Enlightenment thinking turned history into a science, as Enlightenment writers pursued knowledge with new standards. 
The Enlightenment brought more standards for researching and finding new knowledge with things like empiricism and the scientific method, which affected history as well and how people thought about it.
On the flip side, the Enlightenment was very euro-centric, and this applied to history as well in how they wrote about themselves and others.

  I think one of the major things that changed in approach to writing and researching history was the willingness to question the Church and religion in general.
Enlightenment writeres were much more willing to question the Church and tradition in the pursuit of knowledge. 
This changed not only how people wrote their history, but also how they interpreted it.
One thing that didn't change was the focus on their history being the best, depending on whoever wrote it and what country they were from. 

Questions
