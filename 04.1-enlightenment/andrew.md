## Reflections on Enlightenment History

Good morning, 

 It seems to me that the Enlightenment was the intellectual and philosophical fulfillment of Renaissance curiosity. Whereas Renaissance thinkers began to question the legitimacy of Church-prescribed history and flirted with notions of secularism and scientific empiricism, Enlightenment thinkers appear to embrace these concepts wholeheartedly. 
 
 As a result of this embrace, a number of new attitudes and perceptions came to characterize this era. Among these were a quest for historical objectivity, a sense of a universal human nature, an emerging respect for scientific empiricism, and an increasingly secular framework for understanding history. Most fundamental to the Enlightenment as an age of thought was the respect for and exercise of human reason. Intellectuals like Immanuel Kant embodied this adherence to reason in his call for man to use his human faculties to understand the world (Sapere aude!). 
 
Taken together, each of these this new philosophical ideals created an intellectual movement which took on a view of history that, perhaps much like our own, revolves around the notion of progress. Borrowing concepts from the Scientific Revolution, Enlightenment thinkers recontextualized human society as being governed by a set of natural laws which, once understood through rational inquiry, could be used to advance society. Those who applied reason to areas of human society, like politics or history, dubbed themselves philosophes.

Given their focus on progress, philosophes looked to the past not just as an intellectual exercise but rather for the social utility provided by the past, for it through an understanding of the past that Enlightenment thinkers could offer avenues for societal advancement – the study of the past for the sake of the present and future. This shift in purpose also had the effect of materially changing the way historiography was done. Whereas in classical tradition, the purpose of history was to relay moral lessons regarding virtue or the lack thereof, Enlightenment historians sought to uncover the causal relationships between past events to construct a systematic view of history that present society could learn from. 

It’s also worth noting how Enlightenment historiography involved a greater challenge to authority than past intellectual reigns, best exemplified by the writings of Voltaire. Throughout his work, Voltaire appeals to history as a means of decrying that which he views as societally regressive, which usually involved the Roman Catholic Church and various monarchs. In doing so, he furthered what we now call “Enlightenment ideals” such as freedom of worship and the separation of church and state. 

Interestingly, some members of the Scottish Enlightenment, such as William Robertson, utilized history in the same way as Voltaire but arrived at somewhat different conclusions. The stadial theory, a historical perspective surmising that society developments along different modes of production, with each stage becoming more civilized than the last, developed out of the Enlightenment desire to systematically organize history and advance as a society. Yet, while Voltaire’s use of this method serves to further what I’d deem progressive political change, Roberson’s use of the method resulting in stadial theory seems caked in economic/cultural supremacy. While disparate in some ways, both of these historians share a historical methodology and intellectual framework (insofar as they saw history as a tool for societal advancement). 

Another interesting facet of the Enlightenment strain of historiographical thought is the ability to use history as a unifying political force. Rather than appeal to history to expose differences and seek advancement, as Voltaire and Robertson did, historians like Edward Gibbon and Mary Otis Warren took much the opposite approach. In detailing the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, Gibbon denigrated the unorganized European tribes as savage, in contrast to his construction of Rome as being classically civilized. But in his continental portrayal of Rome as a civilization, Gibbon encouraged a European identity with which his readers could relate. 

Mary Otis Warren, while writing just after the American Revolution, applied history in much the way. Post-revolution historians have a unique power in that they can shape the history of the revolution itself, and in doing so justify it retroactively. Warren did just this by constructing a narrative of the American revolution that saw the conflict as a battle between American virtue and British corruption, charactering British taxes a foreign ploy to enslave the good-hearted, free American. One can see how attractive such a history is just after a revolution, both as a means of rationalizing the destruction caused by the revolution and building a new national identity to rally around post-revolution. So oddly enough, while Warren’s history was explicitly nationalist in nature and Gibbon’s somewhat transnational, they each applied history in the same way.

Hopefully it goes without saying that application of history has seriously dangerous potentialities in that it can lead to a toxic in-group/out-group dynamic and fervent nationalism, but nevertheless it remains an important aspect of how history was used during the Enlightenment.
