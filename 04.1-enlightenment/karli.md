Enlightenment historiography utilized *reason and scientific approaches* to what, as Cheng describes, was philosophical history.  Human reason was viewed as necessary to the progress of thinking and the furthering abilities of the human race as a whole, which provides for the philosophical context of Cheng’s assessment.  Promotion of *rational inquiry* was one of the key forces behind new historical writings. 

However, Enlightenment thinkers approached history and figures from history in terms of their own ideals and values, which often meant that (for example the writings of **William Robertson**) historical facts and ideas that were once seemingly important were viewed as substandard and irrelevant to new Enlightenment ideals.  

*Empirical analysis* also became an important component of Enlightenment approaches to historical subjects.  This may be viewed as a continuation of the historical studies of the Early Modern period in the labeling of vice and virtue through making use of exemplar historical events and figures.  

Enlightenment *philosophes* wanted to use human reason as the commonality in emerging history overall to explain why things happened and to divorce fully from the idea of religious or theological interventions in human events.  This idea of secular research had not been completely embraced in the Early Modern period.  

As Cheng noted, **Edward Gibbon** actually attributed the “Fall” of the Roman Empire to the emergence of Christianity, which was in itself a radical statement within his predominantly Christian Eurocentric audience.

**Voltaire** frowned upon the use of historical sources and argued instead that (along with others in this same school of thought) the only thing needed to understand history was a background in politics.  Antiquarians held fast to the ideas of using and critically analyzing *primary sources* to validate actual historical fact from fiction (as seen in the writings of the **Göttingen school** of German historians).  To Voltaire’s credit, however, he was the first historian to attempt an inclusion of broader cultures in his works than just focusing on Europe alone.

The *inclusion of women* in historical studies was also a new event in the Enlightenment age.  Although their contributions were somewhat minimized, Cheng’s description of the writings of **Mary Otis Warren** prove that women were becoming a part of the larger cultural commentaries of the period.  However, their writings were published in formats that were not as scholarly (journals and travel essays), which allowed for this minimization to occur.  

This was still an indication that Enlightenment thinkers were beginning to expand their historical horizons and look beyond their immediate circumstances to address a more wholistic approach to their studies.

*For Further Thought:*

How and why was secularization unique to historical research in the Enlightenment?

Why was political experience seen as critical to historical knowledge at a time when human reason was becoming a central point of concern?
