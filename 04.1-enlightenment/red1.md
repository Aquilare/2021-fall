Enlightenment and philosophical history are rather curious in my honest opinion. The very concept to me is actually kind of like looking and the process of time in two different that also seem to mirror each other.
On the side of Enlightenment, the way that history is portrayed seems to be rather exclusive in its approach as it is opening. By this, I mean in that the glorification of the Ancient Roman and Greek empires as the “pinnacle of civilization” kind of blocks out other civilizations that has given some of the most important concepts to the people of the present globe. For example, the concept of algebra for the Arabic nations.
However, on the other side of that coin, I am not going to downplay the important ideas and concepts of the Greeks and Romans. What they have given, engineering and political triumphs, are just as important in the long run as they also play their roles in the machine of history.
Now, for the realm of the philosophical approach of history, it is less focused on the events themselves, but on the meaning of said events or a least what to take away for them. I would compare them to Machiavelli’s work, The Prince. The idea of learning from those of the past seems to be the main mantra of the philosophical side of history.
