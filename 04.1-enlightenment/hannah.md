What was new about Enlightenment thinking in general?

The Intructionary Guide to Historiography says that there are several different definitions to what the Enlightenment actually is, in one way it can be defined in a broad sense as being the period in which people were inspired to speak out against tradition. To take a deeper definition to what this period was would be to say a way to think that is separate from what the church and other high officials tell people how to think and behave. There's also the definition that applies to the thinkers of this period separately from the other definitions. The thinkers like Voltaire and Gibbon, along with David Hume and Diderot were the ones that believed in thinking in terms of philosophy when discussing history and how to use that method of individual thinking and philosophy to advance society.

In broad terms, how did Enlightenment thinking get applied to History?

History differs from the past because it causes people to look back on important events and people and pick apart so to speak what made these events and people so significant and important, whereas looking to the past is just what lies on the surface and not so much looking deeper. This plays into terms of talking about the Enlightenment period and the thinkers like Voltaire and Gibbon and how they spoke out about thinking for yourself and to separate not only the mind and thought from church, but also to look deeper and be encouraged to look deeper into history in order to advance society as a whole.

What were the commonalities and differences between the approaches to History described in the chapter?

In this chapter, the Enlightenment thinkers found that the commonalities between the approaches of history was to look at history as if it was separate from the church as previously stated and that it was a way of thinking that caused people to think for themselves rather than believing in a norm that was pushed forward by the state officials or the church. The Enlightenment caused people to discuss topics that were not previously allowed to be discussed. This caused people to solve problems and investigate deeper into topics that were put forth from the church.
