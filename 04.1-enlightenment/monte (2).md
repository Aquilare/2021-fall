## Enlightenment


Following the trajectory of thinking from age to age. A major departure from the Renaissance was the idea that Antiquity was the peak and needed to be reincarnated in the modern period. This is not to say that the thinkers of the Enlightenment didn’t have philosophical ancient thinkers postered on the walls but they now believed they could one up the **Greco-Roman** period.

Equating history into a more systematic scientific process became the norm. History became a “*function*” or a “*tool*” that could buff freedom of thought. In fact, since information became more widespread thanks to pamphlets, writings, and the increasing thought that the masses deserved information helped spur on coffee house talks.

This intellectual transformation wasn’t all different. In fact it continued ramping up the separation from weaving religious thought in history. History was becoming more secular, as the focus centered further on humans both individual and the group. If anything it became further opposed to the idea of the church and directly began challenging the religious dogma as described by Enlightenment authors.

We can see how history was directly changed. The idea of freedom of thought and open conversations inspired many of the revolutionaries. As we can witness in both the American and French revolutions. We also see the idea of civilization or death. A tragic view that stemmed partially from Robertson’s view on **levels** of civilization. The hunter, then pastoral, then agricultural, and then commercial.

We see that this thinking led to the idea that all people groups fell on this spectrum, and some thinkers believed that some groups could “*progress*” or needed to be forced into “*progress*”. We even see Warren commenting on the Indegenious peoples of the Americas. It seemed that the idea was that people (Europeans) could determine what was historical progress not God, not the Church, and not people outside of Europe.

1. The study of history seems to be whatever the current society needs it to be. Does historical study change with progressing civilization? Or does the current civilization dictate what historical study is? 

2. While we continued to see the history of great men sort of prevail, why did the monarchy not receive the same pushback as the church in European enlightenment thinking?
