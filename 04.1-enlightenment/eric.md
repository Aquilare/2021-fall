The Enlightenment period is an interesting idea because in the broad sense I always believed it to be a time when great thinkers threw off the shackles of religion and started to in a sense, "think for themselves", but the readings show it was not that simple. The "historians" started to be more secular in their writings of history but they still had beliefs in Christianity that they could not ignore, which showed in their writings. They did start being more critical of Christianity's role in history but still had to tone down their writings because people took this criticism as an attack instead of historical fact. I use fact in a sort of loose term since many of the historical writers did not cite their sources and actually criticized people that did.

The Enlightenment brought about more ideas of challenging the powerful. I liked in the chapter that there was sort of a progression of overthrowing the monarchy. Voltaire needed the monarchy, William Robertson starts to criticize the monarchy, Edward Gibbon saw imperial rule as the cause to the fall of Rome, and Mercy Otis Warren took all of these ideas to write that the American Revolution was just in its overthrow of British rule.

The concept of time is seems to be a reoccurring topic of discussion when it comes to historiography. The essay says Enlightenment thinkers brought about more of linear approach to time but then the chapter shows that the concept of reoccurring cycles of time is being "recycled". Even Enlightenment thinkers could not come away from this belief that human nature repeats itself. It is interesting how they tied it into the conquering of the Americas though. I would think it would make it less of a just cause to take over a society that you think is in a civilization stage behind you instead of one that is a peer or ahead.

I guess one could attribute their willingness to give European expansion a pass to the idea of making progress. The Enlightenment shows that writers of the time believed that progress was inevitable, not because of providence but because humans make it so.


I am still a little confused but why would these generally smart people think citing sources would be a bad thing?

How much of these histories can be trusted if they were filled with conjecture?
