The Enlightenment brought with it a greater separation of religion and history, pushing secular thinking to the forefront whereas prior the two forms had been more or less in tandem. Religous thought and its connection to history did not go away during this period, but instead was viewed differently, falling under the new and improved enlightenment ideals of reason, progress, and even individuality. 

Each historian/philosopher that Cheng highlights during this chapter has their own relationship to how religion relates to the study and interpretation, and impact of history. Voltaire, on the one hand, found there to be no coincidince between the decline of Christianity and the rise of culture and art, and actively argued against organized religion. 

On the other hand, Robertson, who was a minister, saw religion as a part of the providential progression of civilization, but only through secondary causes. Things like the Reformation and the Crusades, while having a negative immediate impact, did in fact progress society as a whole. 

Looking at the other historians that Cheng highlights in this chapter provides two additional viewpoints on religion and secularism as they relate to history. Looking at all four of these people together, one could argue that a movement towards individuality and varying relationships with something, that when just a few decades prior there was basically no lieniency towards, indicates some type of social progression, which indeed was a goal of the enlightenment thinkers. 


Additionally this week, I was struck by Cheng's statement that Enlightenment thinkers were unable to, or possibly unwilling to, understand the past from its own point of view, instead projecting their contemporary beliefs and ideals on past histories. If individuality and reason was so championed during this period, it is interesting to me that this type of thinking wasn't greatly questioned or explored further. 

While I find this interesting, and somewhat confusing, I also think that it fits rather well with the concepts that are discussed in the chapter. We have seen that euro-centrism and nationalism, masquerading as the betterment of the world as a whole, run rampant at the time (all the time, lets be honest). After pondering it further, I find that this sort of ego-trip, 'my way is best' viewpoint isn't all that surprising after all. 

A few questions: 
1. Out of the four historians highlighted, which did you find the most interesting? Was there one that you felt you resonated with more than another? 
2. Do you think that 'the englightenment' is an appropriate title for this shift in historical and philosophical thinking?
