Hello, my name is Michael R Aguilar III. My two greatest interests are music and history. 
I am a senior with a double major in history and philosophy with a minor in political science.
I was born here in Albuquerque, but live just north of here in Bernalillo (which is were I grew up and went to school).
I have been playing drums since I was in fourth grade, and started learning to play the guitar a few weeks ago.
Eventually I hope become a teacher in order to teach history at the high school level.
