Hello all!

My name is Andrew Schumann, but you can call me Drew once we get to know each other. I started college at age 16 through a dual-credit high school on CNM's main campus, so 
despite being 19 and this being my third semester at UNM,  I’m classified as a Junior. I’m aiming to earn a dual-degree, one  in Political Science with a minor in Communication 
and another in History with a minor in Honors (Interdisciplinary Liberal Arts). In my first semester at UNM, I was accepted into the Departmental Honors Program in History, 
and I’m currently working with Dr. Jason Scott Smith to write a thesis about the intersection of social justice advocacy and labor activism in early 20th century America. I was
also recently accepted into the History department BA/MA program! 
 
A couple of my personal interests include music, comics, and debate. I love a lot of old(er) music, and currently my favorites are the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, and 
Frank Sinatra. I'm also a huge comic book fan and have always held a special interest in superhero stories. Ask me about my comic collection sometime! Lastly, hailing from a
Speech and Debate background I'm always down to engage in some challenging discourse. Anyways, I'm looking forward to working with all of you this semester! 
 
Thanks, 
 
Andrew
