Hello everyone! 

My name is Jackie and I am starting my senior year. I am double majoring in archaeology and history with a minor in museum studies. This year I am working on a history honors thesis that is going to be exploring Nordic food cultures throughout the Viking Age. 

I am currently working three part time jobs, two of which are here at UNM, at the Maxwell Museum and at the Office of Contract Archaeology. When I'm not working or in school I love spending as much time outside as possible exploring and traveling. Because of all of the recent travel restrictions, my husband, dog, and I have done **a lot** of camping in the four corners states and have found some truly beautiful and peaceful places. 

I'm also a big nerd who loves the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Doctor Who, RuPaul's Drag Race, and cosplay. 

Looking forward to getting to know you all!
