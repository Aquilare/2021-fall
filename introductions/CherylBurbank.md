Hi! I am Cheryl Burbank.  I graduated in June with a BA in History but I did not get to take this class before I graduated so I am taking it now.
My hobbies are history, genealogy and travel.  I have three kids and seven grandkids.  I am faculty support supervisor at the Law School and love it.  
I cannot wait to learn more about the history of history.
