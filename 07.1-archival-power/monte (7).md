My opinion on the archives in general is mixed. I believe I always assumed archives were huge libraries of knowledge that contained anything and everything a particular institute. I’m not sure why I assumed libraries or archives were these neutral and unbiased entities but I’d never really put any thought into it. I see the flaws presented but also recongize the value.

This is not a **blanket criticism** of the institutions however. I think archives are important, because as we have mentioned again and again. Why we study history has many reasons and what we deem as important changes from person to person. This is simply adding those same reasons onto these archives.

Archives are **run by people** and people will decide what they deem important to store in an archive. What documents, pictures, and items should  be rehoused, preserved, and held within locations. Locations aren’t infinite and neither are funds. So not every amount of information will be taken by an archive. I like that the article referred to archives as social constructs as I’m starting to see what that term really means.

I think this is yet another lesson for the historian. We should question everything, and get multiple sources perhaps from **multiple archives**. Test information against information for a more accurate and unbiased account. If that information only exists in one area, or from one source, or perhaps only at one archive? We should be aware of that and what it can mean for the overall accuracy of the information.

*So treating these vaults of information like anything else we draw information from is a good rule of thumb. We wouldn't pick up a single book from a past account without gathering as many other accounts as we could.*

1. Can information or a source ever be completely accurate or will every source have a degree of biased opinion?
2. What are steps to improve the gathering of information? Or tips for an emerging historian?
