# Are Archival Records To Be Trusted? 
## _concerns over the accuracy and balance of historical archives brings questions of overall historical accuracy_

As students of History, we can often reflect upon the actual truth of the stories we have researched. Typically, truth in story is accepted if that story has factual evidence to back it up. Rarely do we reflect on the sources themselves as possible planted evidence. With the gathering and archiving of information reveled as a highly selective process by those involved with organizing the material, it is difficult to look at any history with one hundred percent credibility.  

For the casual fan of historical stories and the professional historian alike, the belief in a scientific and nonbiased archive of material has been taken for granted and even trusted when it shouldâ€™ve been questioned. Records saved are those of the government in charge. This would almost indicate that negative information would be discarded, however, we do have information that is unflattering to many governments that under the suspicions of archival accuracy, one would not expect to see. Yet we do see these. However, suspicion remains at it should. Cross referencing material might help historians to some extent providing they could find enough collaborating or discrediting information. In many instances, that might be a futile effort. 

This is leading to question if the writing on historical events is even accurate or if we are perpetuating an inaccurate version of history. This means the historian of today needs to be more aware of possible bias even at the primary source level. 

This leads to the necessary need to better understand and implement the archival procedure. To make the gathering, comparing, and testing of information an actively discerning event that each member of society is willing to engage in. Otherwise, we have piles of information told form a biased point, gathered and stored in the eye of agenda, and remembered inaccurately as a result. At best, a partial truth is found with an entire other reality left in the dusty forgotten stories of lives not deemed worthy of remembrance. 





- Newspapers and personal diaries are looked at as primary source materials. In our current popular mode of posting to social media, we act as our own media outlet publishing personal information. In what ways could this add reliable value to our history?  

- What are the ways we can collectively create accurate data basis for future historians?
