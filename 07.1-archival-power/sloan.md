Archives show their power by what they do and don't contain, as well as by who can access the materials.
If an archive only contains information written and complied by one person, then all the information is going to be biased towards that one persons opinion. 
Archives of information can be skewed by what the archivists choose to contain, and what they think should be included.
Archives can also be powerful by who they let into the archive, whether it is a public library for regular citizens or a government archive that requires clearance to be let into.

I honestly didn't really think about archives worked a whole lot before this. 
While I knew to look critically at the individual works I was reading, I never put too much thought into why people kept the works in their archives or libraries to use.
Honestly in high school I assumed that my library used whatever books they were given or donated.

Questions
1. How has public archives changed peoples perception of the world around them? (the transition from private libraries to public ones)
