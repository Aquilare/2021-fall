The archivist profession is faced with many obstacles in the postmodern era, many of which were highlighted in the article by Schwartz and Cook.  Namely, the **biggest issues** facing archival practices today are the questions surrounding inclusivity and the role of the archivist in determining what information or data is worth archiving. 

This is what Schwartz and Cook are emphasizing (over and over again) when they refer to the power wielded by archivists and the decisions made about why information is deemed worthy of saving and therefore proliferating in future research.  In class discussions, we have opined on the idea of the inherent bias of human nature, and this is not lost on archival theory and practices.  

Archivists (aka humans) are swayed by their own *opinions, judgements, and conclusions* when they are preserving and categorizing documents.  They would, of course, rather *die* than admit that they are biased in any sense of the word, as their training is steeped in the ideals of neutral and factual data gathering. 

But (just as our group discussion alluded to), history is itself quite often a collection of narratives and renderings of a past that are enmeshed in bias and partiality.  This is what postmodernist ideals in historical research and methodology have struggled against, and the need for inclusivity has become the overwhelmingly critical lens through which to view modern archival practices.

Its up to the *postmodern historian* to sift through the information contained within archives to root out the narratives and available information in order to stitch together research that approaches something closer to neutrality and inclusivity.  The other side of that need can be to simply state that there is a gaping chasm in what is available, and historians can highlight what information is missing as a means to presenting factual evidence for or against a particular narrative.  Maybe this could be the best attempt that a researcher can make to accuracy in their findings.  

If we have learned anything in our class so far, it is that historians have the incessant task of needing to *consult and confirm or discount sources (as well as citing them)* in order to be true scholars and academicians.  Archives are the “storage vaults” of these sources!!!!  These physical and or virtual holdings can no longer be viewed as extraneous to methods of research.  How that idea ever became reality is a wonder, but it is obvious that **archives are the repositories of cultural records of a multitude of varieties**, and are therefore critical components of what histories will be written now and in the future.  This is incredibly powerful, and those professionals who are custodians of this information truly are powerful themselves.

*For Further Thought:*

Is the role of the archivist becoming more critical than that of the historian or researcher? Why or why not?

What does "inclusivity" mean in terms of archival materials and documents?
