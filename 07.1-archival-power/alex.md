### Archives Power
Archives by the very nature of being are distorted have many reasons. One of those is that Archivist are still human and that they can control what sort of information is kept and which information is not going to kept and be left to be forgotten. This means that by default some information is not going to be available. The exclusion of female point of view is missing as well as many other things. The reasoning is that some of these text goes against the “accepted” social values of a society are. For example, the difference in archival on the war atrocities that the Allies committed compared to the atrocities of the Axis nations during World War Two and how in public memory a lot of the Allies war crimes have gone unnoticed while everyone still knows about what the Axis have done. The other reason is for a majority of the past the archives really only held the voices of the powerful and not the marginalized people. 

Now for the fact that the Historian uses archives to write their histories I believe it comes down to what type of history they are writing. If the historian is writing an economic history, then the archives and the confidence of the historian on writing a more accurate story. Now if the same historian was writing about a different subject, then they will have to be extremely critical and may have to less accurate because of the lack of preserved information in the archives. And that the damage has already been done in a lot of archives on certain subjects. Especially the further back into the past you go the other perspectives become harder to get a hold of because they were not kept in the archives. 

Archives should be thought as active shapers in societies because one they are the center of knowledge and records of what the society believes to be important and what they wanted the future to know of the past. They hold enormous power to shape the public identity, meaning where they came from and how they got to where they are today. That If archives stay in the background, then they will want to stay with the status quo and not expand ideas. Meaning that there can be a separation between society and what has been kept in the archives. On the other hand, if they are seen as active shapers, it also changes how a historian looks at the material held inside the archives, and they can think about the story that the archives are trying to tell people.
