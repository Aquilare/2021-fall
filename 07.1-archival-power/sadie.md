# Archival Power
Have you ever put a lot of thought into how archives shape and direct both the past and future? Well, I have. I question who gets to make the determinations of what is right and wrong? Why do they get to have that power? What are they not telling us? Why do we rarely question these things? It’s interesting that we just allow someone/thing to tell us what is important and how be. I question everything and apparently with good reason.  

 Archives have dictated and reinforced societal norms, culture, and memory for many centuries. They dictate what we think, how we view the world, and reinforce narratives to enhance certain powers in the world. This is because archives wield the power over the narratives of history, they create and dictate social values, cultural identities, and institutional accountability. 

Some of the keyway's archives manifest their power is through memory and identity. Schwartz & Cook deconstruct archival power because it *“represents enormous power over memory and identity, over the fundamental ways in which society seeks evidence of what its core values are and have been, where it has come from, and where it is going”* (Schwartz & Cook).  

Archives manifest power by controlling the narrative of how we think about ourselves and societies. *“Through archives, the past is controlled and shapes and directs historical scholarship, collective memory, and national identity”* (Schwartz & Cook). Archives reinforce and uphold social constructs because they wield the *“power over information”* that shapes and directs institutions (Schwartz & Cook).  

Everything we learn and know about the world is predetermined and chosen by archivists. These "layers which become naturalized, internalized, and unquestioned”, is how archives manifest power, through maintaining, enhancing, and reinforcing certain narratives that are dictated by the few for the many (Schwartz & Cook). Control over the archives gives control over society by having the control of determining what is chosen to be revealed to us, and what is not, in what light it is too be reflected in, and how the information can be utilized to either maintain, enhance, protect, and/or reinforce control and power.
