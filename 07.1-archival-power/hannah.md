We’ve talked about the difficulties of objectivity and truth in history, and this article explains how archives are far from a neutral site of data-gathering.
How and why are archives distorted?
I think it is important to note that archives of any sort but especially of the history context can be distorted because as we discussed in class, who is to say what is fact from fiction.
I think that we as a society and as individuals have trusted the archive of scholars because they have the credentials for what they are saying, but these truths may also be distorted to appeal more to the public to get more attention.
Given that they are the basis for history, is it possible for a historian using archives to be accurate in terms of reporting about the past?
I think that in terms of history, reporting about the past is all about presenting a piece of the puzzle with supporting evidence from other well known scholars to make the historians point out and to gain more credibility. 
We typically think of archives as in the background, but why should they be considered active shapers of society?
Archives shape the ways in which people read about history, and them being called “archives” makes them sound old and therefore more credible because they are themselves from the past. Archives gives whosoever using them the power to credibly say something about history which in term gains more popularity from the public making them more credible in the long run.
Who is to say what becomes archives and what doesn't?
Why is history so focused on learning from these archives to be credible?
