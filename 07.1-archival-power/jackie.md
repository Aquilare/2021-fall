## The Problem with Archives

Archives, both as records, and in an institutional capacity, have been around for centuries if not longer. Schwartz and Cook, in their article "Archives, Records, and Power: The Making of Modern Memory" even mention that archivists hold the title for second oldest legitamate profession. As with history and historiography, with so much time passing and so many shifts in socially, politically, and religious framed thinking, it is no surprise that with all of that comes challenges. 

At the root of these challenges, particularly as we view them today, the question surrounding archival practices, much like history, is **who decides?** Who decides what stories are worthy to be told, who decides what records are worthy for safe keeping, and if they are an appropriate representation of events? 

Schwartz and Cook argue that archives are inherently biased, socially constructed, powerful institutions that "embody and shape public perceptions of what is valuable and important" (8). While archives collect, house, and protect historical records and objects, it is important for the everyday person, and especially the researcher, to comprehend, if not come to terms with, the agenda and biases of the archival institution. 

Similarly to earlier viewpoints held by historians, archivists too have their own perceptions when it comes to the importance of what to collect and save. Not only are archivists influenced and swayed by the power and regulations of their institution, but their own viewpoints come into play, be it social, religious, or political. This two-fold system multiplies the power that archives as a whole can have over the shaping of history and memory. 

Archival and historical practices become even more tricky when the universally accepted research standards are to consult primary source documents, which are often found in archives. 

Modern archival and historical practices have become significantly more capable and accepting of questioning the practices of the past in order to break down some of the power and bias struggles. Despite the struggles, however, archives should not be cancelled and historians should not stop using them as tools to produce their work. 

I believe that archives can be incredibly useful in providing **part** of an accurate historical picutre, but not necessisarily the **whole** picture. Archives are a helpful tool if one is critical and analytical about the sources they are viewing. 

A question:
1. How can archives and archivists improve their collection policies to incorporate and perpetuate non-biased viewpoints? Is it even possible?
