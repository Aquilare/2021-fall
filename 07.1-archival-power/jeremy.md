Reading reflection

•	We’ve talked about the difficulties of objectivity and truth in history, and this article explains how archives are far from a neutral site of data-gathering. How and why are archives distorted?

I think the reason that these archives get distorted according to the article have to be viewed in a postmodern way to see archives “as institutions wield power over the administrative, legal and fiscal accountability of governments corporations and individuals, and engage in powerful public policy debates around the right to know, freedom of information, protection of privacy, copyright and intellectual property, and protocols for electronic commerce.” (page 2) Archivist’s viewed through this lens can no longer be viewed as neutral arbiters of information because they actually have a very large role in access and censorship of the information that you may be looking for.  

•	Given that they are the basis for history, is it possible for a historian using archives to be accurate in terms of reporting about the past?

The Historian has to be very critical and be able to construct and deconstruct the archives and the process of collectivization. Here in the article we see the need for Historians to pay attention to context and how that also affects the collection process. “As scholar’s historians, anthropologists, cultural theorists, cultural geographers, sociologists, and others increasingly discover and focus upon context, it is essential to reconsider the relationship between archives and the societies that create and use them.” (page 5) There has to be a critical eye for how the archives in society are being created and to what end may the state or other powerful entities may be using archives to highlight certain events and to minimize others. 

•	We typically think of archives as in the background, but why should they be considered active shapers of society?

We have to think of archives as shapers of society because as we saw in the article that they are not neutral arbiters of information because when we use the postmodernists lens and see Archives as institutions we can see how they can shape, change, and influence the historical narrative and are not immune from being influenced by larger or more powerful entitles who have their own personal agendas. 

Question/s 

Are Micro histories a good deterrent from archival influence? 

Are archives, as we have seen with other issues with the historical narrative too Eurocentric? Can getting away from the prism of Europe allow archives to be less problematic?
