**Consciousness.**  

Fulbrook’s attention to the paradigms that shape historical theory, her awareness of how those theories shape historical representations, her ability to cite and counter particular arguments made for or against a certain type of historical theory or idea, are just some of the reasons why I feel she presents a need of consciousness for all historical thinkers.

Summarizing what I feel her most important points were are:

Be aware of the paradigms that you use yourself and that you will encounter when you read other historical works.  Understand how these paradigms will shape the narrative you are reading and be conscious of your own biases towards the topic and those of the writer (if possible).  Embrace the idea that, to some degree, historical accounts have been imbued with gap-filling details or information that are likely more educated conjectures on the part of the historian. 

Don’t get bogged down in the historical arguments made, but have a clear idea about them and why they may or may not apply to a particular work.  This is the most compelling idea that Fulbrook explored because it basically means that (and she states this as well) we will continue to participate in history as a discipline, and because of this the arguments of various schools of server to highlight the scientific or philosophical points they are making, but in the end are not as relevant to the discussion overall.




Dear Future Historiography Student:

Here are some tips on reading Mary Fulbrook’s *Historical Theory*.

First of all, **don’t get hung up on understanding every concept or argument presented.**  She is writing in a manner that can seem overwhelming and is meant to be challenging, but do your best to grasp the main points of her topics.  Take your time and if you need to, read something that seems confusing or difficult two or three times to make sense of it.  

Secondly, don’t be completely unnerved if Fulbrook *never provides an unequivocal answer to something*.  The biggest take away from her approach is to better appreciate all the sides of an argument and to understand their impact on historical theory overall.  She does leave you breadcrumbs to find if you are looking for hard and fast answers, but answering definitively is not her main objective in this book.  For example, she never states what is the absolute best historical paradigm or answers how translation across paradigms can actually be achieved.

Her approach to describing competing theories and presenting the contrary ideas about each of them was what I found most helpful and it allowed me to gain **1)** a greater appreciation for historical work in general, and **2)** gave me the basis for using her points about different or competing ideas in a way that was more critical.  I will definitely tell you that you will now see history in very different terms and will apply that critical lens to what you encounter going forward.

Lastly, it’s confusing at times, but *worth the work to read* Fulbrook and appreciate her efforts at presenting a very complex and complicated set of ideas and nuances into a book that’s less than 200 pages in length.

Best of luck,

Karli Snyder
