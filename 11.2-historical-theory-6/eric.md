SCOPE

A lot of Mary Fullbrook’s argument hangs on what a historian should and should not answer. Writing history is not always going to be clear cut so the historian has to be upfront and explain what their writing is trying do. Introductions chapters try to do this, but they do not usually make it as noticeable as possible that the author does not want them to ask any questions outside of what the author has written. Fullbrook is also trying to get the point across that historians cannot really get out of their normal way of writing so do not fault them for writing the only way they know how.

Dear Prospective Student,

Before cracking open Historical Theory, I think you should have a dictionary handy. I mean this in the broadest of senses by thinking that just because one has a PhD and they are writing for other PhDs, it does not mean that they have to write like a PhD to get their point across, especially when the writing is about such abstract ideas that a layperson would have such a difficult idea understanding.

Speaking of understanding, you are likely not going to comprehend everything Mary Fullbrook writes about. There are a lot of ideas that come down to “so what?”. Fullbrook does not explicitly use that phrase so it makes it difficult to know when that comes up, but you should get a general sense of when it happens. Just know that a lot of her counterarguments boil down to so what? We can’t fix that because history is completely unknowable but it doesn’t meant that we shouldn’t try. 

This might sound like a counterintuitive idea for a book in a college course but that is just fine. Historical Theory is a learning tool. You might now capture everything is it trying to tell you but learning a few new things is good enough in my opinion.

Sincerely,
    
Eric
