# Final Reflections on Fulbrook, Historical Theory VI

___Apologia___

When rifling through my internal thesaurus to find a single word that captures the essence of Fulbrook’s message, I decided upon the above word - apologia. Stemming from the Greek apologos, apologia translates to "a speech in defense" and it’s usually used in reference to a written document offering a formal defense of a person or idea. As I see it, this term is quite fitting given that Fulbrook’s apparent goal throughout the book is to defend the study of history. So much of the book, especially toward the end, is encouraging readers to not give up on history as a meaningful pursuit. She acknowledges many of the postmodern critiques of history, but nonetheless implores readers that we can still get something out of history, that studying the past is still a worthwhile venture. Our methods for writing history may be creative and somewhat literary and our theoretical frameworks may not be shared universally, but through reframing ourselves as puzzle-solvers and tour guides rather than novelists and gatekeepers, historians can foster a dialogue that can increase our level of historical understanding. Fulbrook could’ve titled her book “In Defense of History” and it would have made just as much if not more sense. 


Dear future Historiography student, 

I write to you with the utmost sincerity in the hopes that you will appreciate Mary Fulbrook’s Historical Theory as much as I did. I admit that when I first embarked on my journey through Fulbrook’s work, I found it to be dense, evasive, and generally difficult to grasp her overall argument. You will likely share this initial impression of the book, and perhaps this is unsurprising given that the text is written for professional historians. However, once you’ve spent some time absorbing the text and mulling it over in your mind, I think you’ll come to better understand the terms Fulbrook refers to (it can take a while before you acclimate to the books internal language community) and subsequently her overall argument. 

I caution you not to concern yourself too much with the numerous individual historians she mentions or the precise historiographical jargon present throughout the book. As long as you understand the component pieces to Fulbrook’s argument, you can avoid getting lost in the weeds. As I see it, Historical Theory consists principally of three parts. First, Fulbrook expertly navigates both the empiricist claims to history and the postmodern critiques of history, leaving readers with a better understanding of both approaches and their respective merits and shortcomings. Second, she offers an alternative approach to conceptualizing historical writing, arguing that historians write within language communities and within the context of separate theoretical paradigms. Third, using the previous two parts in conjunction, Fulbrook ultimately argues that history is not without purpose, and that even in spite of the postmodern critiques levied toward the field, we still can learn much from history. 

While it is by no means an easy read (not the least because of the book’s vexingly minuscule font), Fulbrook’s work is more than worth your time as you attempt to grow your understanding of historical writing, how ideological and theoretical divides impact the study of history, and the utility of history in a postmodern world. 

All best wishes and encouragement,
