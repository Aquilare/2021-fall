## Final Reflection

If I had to sum up the book in one word, it would be *paradigms*. Not the singular, but the plural. This is because a major theme I found in the book I found was the plurality of these pradigms, and how they shape how history is viewed and understood differently for people operating from different paradigms. A second or third choice would have been *transparency* or *awareness*, but ultimately those likewise boil down to paradigms, since it would have to be regarding one's own paradigms that one is being transparent or aware.  

I feel like at the end of the day, concepts such as transparency and awareness are ultimately empty, so to speak, without something to qualify them. In the mere talking about talking about paradigms to begin with, it makes the historian aware of their own paradigms by nature, and it seems to me that awareness about something that one was previously unaware of lends itself, likewise rather naturally, to transparency about that which for a person was made aware, at least to a degree or in part.

Therefore, to answer this absurd question: one word with which to describe *Historical Theory* is paradigms.

#### Letter to a future student

Dear future student, 

As difficult, abstract, and seemingly ungrounded in reality *Historical Theory* by Mary Fulbrook might be or seem, it is really a very thought provoking and eye-opening read. Take your time with it, soak in all the information. Read ahead so you can have time to re-read it, because chances are that you are going to need to. Understanding it may be rather exhausting at times, but you will emerge a more critical and well-rounded historian, I believe. 

When you finish the book, it will hopefully make you more critical of the histories you read or hear. This is by no means a bad thing. It simply means that it will hopefully make you more mindful about how history is written and understood and will enable you to work with the histories you read or hear on a deeper level. Furthermore, it will help you reflect on your own understanding of history and perhaps why that understanding is the way that it is. Be forewarned though. If you are anything like me, the questions it provokes may distract you from other history courses you may be taking, as you lose yourself in the curiosity of how the history you are learning is understood and written by the day's dominant scholarship; that is, under what paradigms do they operate.

I hope the book is as thought-provoking for you as it was for me.

Sincerely, a past student.
