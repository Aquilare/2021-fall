# Fulbrook in a Word 
## _Real_


The argument of postmodernism, that history is a construct of the present to understand the past in a way relevant to today, thus fictional, is not true. History is alive and well, and very complex. So, in the argument of Fulbrook, history takes on both itself and the historian to reconstruction the past. 
Fulbrook argues that historical understanding can come from various constructs, various sources, and various points of view. Each carries a truth that can be seen. Even that which can not be seen is a voice of the past. 


## _Letter to Future Student_ 

Dear Historiography Student, 

As you read and try to understand Fulbrook, take heart. You are a college student and college is not meant to be easy. Learning can be difficult, and Fulbrook with a wealth of academic research in her armor tackles the subject of history and its usefulness in a lofty warrior way. One will need to keep up and be diligent to begin to understand, and the adventure is well worth it. Also, expect now to read and re-read this work both during and after History class. 

History can be understood in an abstract way and needs both story and fact to bring it to life again. Folbrook brings to reality the truth of history, in that their may be no truth at all. 

During the reading of this book, I found it necessary to re-read many of the paragraphs. To understand that when Fulbrook spoke of understanding the historian as well as the words being written by the historian. Framework is indignant of point of view. Point of view can differ from another, yet both may be true. 

In an age that wonders what one can do with a degree in history, Fulbrook argues for the need of historians. A variety of such people who will sort out and tell the story of the past while being clear as to how they are doing so. 

Fulbrook introduces us to the being of history that lives with us today. One of complexity. A living breathing construct of what we understand the past to be. Brought to life by different tools of analysis. With a well thought out breath of life from the historian. 

Good luck, and do not give up on Fulbrook. She is a fighter of truth who speaks in academic ways. Any solider of the truth will do so at times. In the end, you will find truth and understanding in the prusuit of History.
