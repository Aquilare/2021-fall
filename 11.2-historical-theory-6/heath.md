The word I would use to describe the book is: Reconstructive. 

 

To put this word into context its most in reference to the metaphor Fullbrook used when describing “post post-modernism.” She specifically asks how we can start putting the “debris” of history back together after post-modern thought metaphorically nuked the concept of historical truth. It might also work well as a reference to the period of reconstruction in the south after the civil war.  

Throughout her book Full explains the various arguments made by post-modernists. Mainly that history cannot be entirely true or accurate for a variety of reasons including personal bias, certain literary elements of history, and paradigms. Should the post modernist beliefs be taken, the extreme authors of history are writing fiction in that we cannot ever reach the truth for the above reasons. However, Fullbrook offers that yes, it is true that all those issues exist with authors of history and should be minimized; but given all of these flaws and imperfections history still has value.  

Finally, Fullbrook again mentions the plurality of history, that is that there are many ways in which to view the same event. For example, you could look at a war through the lenses of each side that fought it, those caught in the middle, and an infinite number of other ways. This, however, does not mean that history can be questioned or even disproven. Naturally history isn’t simply black and white, multiple sides can be correct; but this doesn’t mean everything is necessarily right. 

I also enjoyed a a statement by fullbrook in the conclusion. It states that often times as humans we seek to know what we can leave behind for the next generation, and one of these things is the historical achievements. Naturally, through the generations culture, ideas, and values change thus changing the questions, lenses, and frameworks we look through for history. Thus we can only accumulate the facts and hope that they help the future generations answer the questions that will rise up as new ideologies are discovered. 

 

Letter to Future students: 

One of the core skills that this class requires is a deep understanding of vocabulary and an ability to differentiate between words and concepts that seem synonymous and parallel to each other. This is because the concepts of this class are so very abstract that they reach levels the point where to a certain extent you're almost discussing human psychology. You will especially be discussing how this relates to reprentation of different demographics. Also be ready to have history ruined for you for the most part for the first half of the class. The back half sort of returns some of the childlike enthusiasm for history but once you’ve seen taken a look at the mechinism through which history operates you start noticing it everywhere.
