## Discovery

This is not only the word I’d use to describe the book but what I’ve pulled from the book. Discovery represents what I think I’ve learned from reading this book (*that and how dense a 200 page book could be!*). Not just discovering information for the first time, but a constant discovery of new and relevant information. As described throughout the book, history is a puzzle. 
    
It’s several pieces that need to be put together or reformed, and sometimes spin the puzzle around because it’s **upside down**. Like Fulbrook details, the metaphor isn’t really the important part, it’s the questioning and recognizing. Recognizing not only that history doesn’t have one defined way that works, in fact it's a series of testing hypotheses.

I enjoyed the view of seeing history as a glass, darkly. It’s a constant testing of different ideas and ways of viewing history. Different paradigms create different ways of viewing the same historical story. We may never get the whole story but every investigation should be done openly and as inquisitive as possible. Not just asking why this happened, but what is missing.


**Dear** Future Student,

Don’t get overwhelmed. I want to say that first and foremost. The text can be very confusing and the wording can make you reread a few times. (It did for me anyway). Don’t be afraid to read over the text a few times and trust me, skimming doesn’t cut it.

In my opinion the book doesn’t present just a single view but goes back and forth between different ways to observe history. It doesn’t present a clear answer but a multitude of answers on how further this detective style of piecing together history. The overlap of historical styles, and the shifting of science, literature, stories, and history can sometimes be dizzying but recognize that we can’t always determine the root or distinct why. You will start to further **question** every source of history. Which isn't a bad thing.
