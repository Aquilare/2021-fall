*Historical Theory* in one word = **Transparency**.

I chose transparency as the word to describe Fulbrook's book primarily because it was the first word that popped into my head, a gut reaction, when I read the prompt. Also because Karli chose something that was too similar the word **awareness** which was my second choice. 

While Fulbrook goes into grand theoretical detail regarding paradigms and metanarratives and such, her aims are for historians to become more aware, and therefore more transparent with their work. Transparency can be practiced by understanding what sorts of presuppositions and biases they have, why, and how they might impact their writing and reading. It is equally important to be transparent to themselves as well as their audiences. Holding themselves and others accountable can lead to productive and open communitcation which can lead to growth and understanding. 

We all know that history can be at times complex and confusing, and that it can be viewed in a matter of different ways, and as Fulbrook says in her conclusion, "seeing through a glass, darkly". This is perfectly acceptable and even encouraged. Different viewpoints and paradigms make the world, as well as the past and its interpretations, an interesting place. However, whatever worldview, paradigm, or metanarrative, etc. a historian prescribes to and puts out in to the world, should be done as transparently and as openly as possible.

Dear Future Historiography Student,

If you're anything like me, you're going to have a rough time reading *Historical Theory* by Mary Fulbrook. Don't get discouraged, it's okay! This book is theoretically dense and designed for professional historians. There are references to concepts and people you will likely have never heard of before. There will be pages that you will read and re-read and re-re-read and they still won't make sense. 

Be easy on yourself. Take notes and ask a lot of questions during the discussions in class. Don't be afraid to think outside of the box. I had a really difficult time with much of this because it was first foray into really abstract historical thought processes and concepts. It was intimidating, but I took a lot of solace in knowing that many of my classmates had just as difficult a time as I did. 

Regardless of the challenges, it will be worth it. By the end of the book you will look at history as a whole, as well as your personal relationship with it, in a new, different, and exciting way.

Good luck!

Jackie
