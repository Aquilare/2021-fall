- Fulbrooks main point in one word, transparency. I feel this way because she mentions it throughout the book and ends the book with this statement; “to do with honesty, openness and willingness to revise...” (196). What is meant by transparent, is in terms of a historian's intensions. Some historians' interpretations, assumptions, work within theory and must be open about that. Its central because “heightened awareness of key issues historians face, which is a realization that processes of historical investigation and representation are inevitably, intrinsically theoretical enterprises,” being aware of parameters, of what we are doing, rather than blindly conforming to varied contemporary pressures maybe” (196).  

- Fulbrook’s Historical Theory is interesting and deeply philosophical. I think its useful towards debates with skepticism surrounding historiography. Historical Theory is very thought provoking and requires time and patience. You will have to read, re-read, and re-read each chapter again and again, because this is a scholary work and speaks to that level, which we are not at yet. Don't feel bad about having to do this or feeling this way, practically everyone in class does and/or did. Clarity comes with conversations in class, so try to be there and be open about your understanding and others understandings. This class just requires a lot of time so just be perpared for that.
