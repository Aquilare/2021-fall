# Historical Theory Conclusion #

**Bridge**
At the end of class on Monday when Prof. Gibbs asked us to think of a word that describes Mary Fulbrook’s main point, I instantly thought of **bridge**. 

Throughout the entire book, Fulbrook is constantly bringing up concepts, ideas, theories and finding a way to link them in a way that does not fully discredit one another. For example, Fulbrook never minced words when it came to her critique of postmodern historians and their pessimistic view on the overall study of history, but she never discredited those historians, she found a way to bridge postmodern thinking to paradigms. 

Once Fulbrook introduced the paradigms, she was connecting them to the investigation and representation of history. We’ve learned, since Week 5, that postmodern theorists have the tendency to form these disconnects in the history department by nitpicking history, narrative and research. Fulbrook doesn’t play into this negativity, instead she offers other historian opinions who do not share postmodern thought, but instead offers connections for the reader to make to keep historical theory evolving.

Fulbrook’s mentioning of paradigms changed the way I thought about my approach of history now, and as someone going into grad school. The way Fulbrook was explicit in her idea of *transparency* and being *critical* in the pursuit of history has changed the way I view history because it’s bridged my past (and rather pessimist) view on history, and the new, more critical, and open view of history.

*Dear future Historiography student,*
So, you’re taking Historiography (I’m assuming) because you like history, right? Well, remember that when it’s Week 11 and a lot of what you thought you knew about history is *really* scrambled. But it’s worth it, oh man, is it worth it.

Fulbrook is going to be confusing, *Historical Theory* is going to be confusing and you’re going to wish you had more time to read, then reread a chapter because at times it won’t make sense. But again, it’s worth it because in the end it does make sense. Don’t get caught up on the big words, or even the enormity of what Fulbrook is saying because it’s only going to confuse and discourage, and that’s not what Fulbrook’s point in writing this book is. Instead, have a paper and pencil near you as you’re reading and just jot down the things that will jump out at you. It’s going to be useful when you’re thinking of the continuing education you’ll need as a historian; it’s going to change a lot for you and that’s going to be okay. 

It’s going to be confusing, especially when it comes to the ideas of paradigms but **see it through**. Plus, you’ll more than likely own the book—read it again, read it until it makes sense—and eventually it will. It’s going to make you a better learner, not even reaching into the history sphere, it’s going to make you better at being transparent and being critical.

Good luck, and remember, don’t overthink it.
