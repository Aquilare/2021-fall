# Language, Sources, and Categories 
## _understanding how perspectives create the voices of the past_



In Chapter five of Fulbrook,  we look at the techniqueâ€™s historians use to transmit historical information. Namely, the time argued practice of labeling, categorizing, and descriptive language. 

The language used by historians is essential to understanding information and will affect the way in which the information is transmitted. Language used will lift one perspective and lower another. If the historian writes in a way that embraces language of the time, the piece might be interpreted differently than if the writer would have ignored the categories of the past. 

To escape a concept might be impossible for the historian who will use concepts to define and explain events. The decision to use universally accepted ideas such as Nation or Gender can be viewed differently by people not of the place and time being described. This could lead to misunderstandings of past events. Gender has been described in the terms of physical reproduction. This is a construct that leaves out Gender understanding based on terms of emotional and physical traits such as masculinity and femininity. Social constructs of gender based on this notion rather than productive organs would redefine the way in which historical figures were remembered.

Taking perspective from a group of people or a Nation to the Individual is a key concept for Fulbrook. Even though it is desired, it seems impossible to do. Even the most famous of individuals, such as the Buddha, will be placed in history among time and place to what was relevant for him. Thus, a historical figure who transcends place in time is still assigned a seat in the halls of history. Therefore, categorized. 

The Framework we chose to view history in revels the takeaway, or conclusion we will come to.

In Chapter Six of Fulbrook, we look at source material as framework for understanding history. Viewing historical records in various frameworks will determine the role and worth of source material. Here, Folbrook debates the usages of source material. Expanding source material has given historians a better look at the nuances of history. Especially different groups of people. The degree of acceptance, we allow to certain pieces of source material seems to be based upon the current times historical pursuits. 



- Would we be able to have a different view of historical individuals in History if Gender constructs were viewed as fluid? 
- Do we have a way today to truly understand concepts of the past? 


- Do we as postmodernist have an ability to view source material accurately?
