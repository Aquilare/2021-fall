It's interesting to note that Fulbrook is saying that as historians, it’s their job to retell a truth from the past. She states that it's impossible to retell the past from a completely accurate position, being that the historians were not there. 
She says that the use of language and the way the history is told, is important that the proper language is presented. She makes the claim that if historians want to tell history as accurately as possible, than it's important to do it in the most explicit way, even bringing in what Max Weber called “ideal types”, and there is an argument to be made here of the generalized concept of “ideal types'' and the use of the ideal type can't be morally and politically neutral, and there lies the problem. 
Fulbrook says that if historians want to use an explicit way in telling history, that there must be the use of interpretive tools in retelling that history. 
	
  Fulbrook, then, starts to talk about the way scientists engage in telling their versions of history and how that's different from the ways in which historians tell their histories. 
  She states that both uses of history have the same purpose in the end, to find and tell an universally shared, and socially accepted truth about the histories their telling. 
  She stated then, discussing the idea of concepts and listing and describing the different types of concepts. There's anachronistic concept, which is a concepts that deals with the idea that historians treat history as “foriegn” or, that history is presented as an other worldly concept. 
  Then, there's 'theory-drenched’ concepts, these concepts discuss the use of history as a way of distancing from what happened to theorizing as to what could have happened. 
  This distance can often cause the historian to only see a piece of history through one lens, and not piecing together what actually happened. 
  But the counter to that, is that there is no way of knowing, as historians, what actually happened, unless, of course, it comes from a first person account. 
  Therefore this concept can be a useful tool, but it also still has its limits. She goes into what are the ‘ideal types’ and how they are used for history purposes. 
  She brings in, again the use of Max Webster’s method of ‘ideal types’ and that a historian can't form historians and use a reality based analysis. 
  He suggests that there is a difference between reality and cultural relevance. 
	
  Finally, there's a section in which Fulbrook describes the concept of what she calls “source criticism” and that, it's a way of logically looking at history and then filling in the gaps in the timelines and pictures in a scholarly and research-based way. 
  She draws ties from postmodernists ideas of there not being any such thing as a history purely based in reality, and drawing conclusions from reality based histories goes with the implication that it shares ties with human significance. 
  There is also the idea of telling history through different lenses, meaning that in order to tell history, one must first look at the documentation of that history and then interpret the documents in a way that uses them, but also use the concept of theorizing to complete the whole picture of that history. 
  She mentions such examples of these concepts through the discussion of the French Revolution and the Holocaust and how these concepts were used in the retelling of these historical events. 
  Then lastly, there's the mention of comparative histories and how the use of sources, be if from first, second, or even third handed accounts are only as good as the way in which the historian uses them to tell the history that is being investigated. 
  Sources dont give historians the overall picture, they are, instead, just pieces and clues of that bigger overall story of the history that is being looked at.
