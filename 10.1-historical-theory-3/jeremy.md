Reading reflection

For EACH chapter (so your reflection will have 2 distinct parts, and multiple paragraphs within each part), restate and “essentialize” what Fulbrook is arguing without cutting out all the nuance. In other words, the challenge here is to generalize without over generalizing. Describe theoretical problem she presents, the different sides of the debate, and her resolution of the problem.
Chapter 5: Labeling the Parts: Categories and Concepts.

Fulbrook starts off chapter 5 by stating that whether some historians like to admit it or not that all historians operate in terms of categories and concepts when they want to write about and or discover parts of the past. Fulbrook also goes on to say that language can be an obstacle in writing a clear and concise topic of History because language is loaded with political and social connections that are impossible to avoid. So, by stating the challenges that categories and concepts and language we see next how Fulbrook is going to argue that its best to try to try to develop a morally neutral retelling of the past for the Historian to try to not put a personal opinion or become emotionally involved in the subject at hand in order to get a better account of what the Historian is writing about. Fulbrook goes on to say that this Is not going to be easy and that it’s very hard and almost impossible to have concepts and to show neutrality that will cut across multiple cultures and be accepted universally. So, by giving us this frame of the difficulty of remaining neutral and by using concepts Fulbrook still believes that its best for Historians to follow this path when writing or thinking about people and events from the past. She also goes on to say that concepts should be used as tools and to remain open to all frameworks that other Historians may be using. 

The slipperiness of social constructs: 

In this section Fulbrook talks about how in the natural world we can see empirical truths bare out like with the table of elements and how it differs from the human world Fulbrook goes on to say that many people can look at the same subject and come up with different and varying ideas on how the particular event or person. So, this also presents a challenge for the study of History and Social sciences because it we can’t come to an agreement or have universal truths how can we come to a consensus on stories from the past? This is another obstacle that Historians need to keep fighting against. 

The inescapability of concepts; or, all Historians do it anyway: 

Fulbrook goes on again that concepts are going to be used that they can be a useful tool of Historians in order to tell the story about a certain time frame. In the book Fulbrook gave us the example of Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution and we can look deeper into the states of government and how they were shifting during this time also we can also monitor patterns and cause and effect analysis of the events as well. Later on, Fulbrook also broke down concepts with regards to gender relations and how women would fit into the historical narrative. Fulbrook also talks about how the nation state can be problematic in the retelling of the historical narrative because sometimes the whole country can be used as the reason for a certain action taking place instead of a small group of elites at the top of French society making those decisions. 
‘Anachronistic concepts’; or, the problem of immanence 

Here we see the tern anachronistic concepts as seeing them from a different time that is foreign to us today. There is contention among Historians to leave this time of framework or to discuss it as is or to look at it from a perspective that is more modern sort of like a revisionist view of History. 

Theory drenched concepts 

Here we see the use of Jargon or specific language to try to help interpret the past. Theory drenched concept seems to be narrowly defined and used to find clear examples of context. The example given was Marx’s theory of class and how that was used who are the groups of people in this example what is their relationship between on another and so on. With this we see mainly the relationships between the people and the state. 

Construction of concepts as “Ideal types”

We now look at Max Weber and his distinction of “Ideal Types” here Weber is talking about one sided construct that he calls Ideal types and how he can run them against reality and see how they can hold up. 

Concepts, evidence and the emergence of new interpretation

I like this part because we get a metaphor about categories and concepts being like a big fishing net that can be cast into murky water and the quality of the net the size of the holes in the net can influence the type of fish we are going to be able to catch. The netting acts as the prior framework on how to gather the evidence 

Chapter 6: Looking for Clues, The Question of Evidence. 

In this chapter Fulbrook is seeing how there is a very large scope for interpreting the same evidence in very different ways.  She gives us the examples of the Salem Witch Trials and the French Revolution and Hitler and the Holocaust and we can see how as more time has been put between these three events how once again the evidence can be looked at differently with a large framework in place. In order to do this Fulbrook states we need to carefully look at the nature of the sources and how they have eventually evolved. Fulbrook also mentions archive positivism I’m not exactly sure what she means by this I think she’s saying that it can be a negative to take what the archive is saying in a positive light that there must be some criticism for the archive. There was also the part from Kellner that I really enjoyed as well about “History is not about the “past” but its about creating something meaningful from the scattered and profoundly meaningless debris scattered around us”(107)  I like this interpretation because it shows how there is not clear cut view of History that it goes back to that notion that there a puzzle pieces waiting to be put back together. 
I think that through this chapter Fulbrook is giving a wide selection of interpretation and  ways to find clues with regards to the narrative. I think the main takeaway that Fullbtook wanted us to have was to be aware of the process and to seek out investigative strategies that will help you connect ideas together in a way that will allow others to be able to further upon your ideas and amend them in the future using the same tools and framework. 


Questions 

Will the quest for neutrality be able to calm tensions on the state level regarding the historical narrative? Is it possible to be neutral in a State interpretation of a historical event?
