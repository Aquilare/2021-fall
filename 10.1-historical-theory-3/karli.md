Fulbrook discusses the need to (first of all) understand how categories and concepts are used by historians to research, pose questions about, and write about historical topics.  However, there is not a universally held understanding of what these categories and concepts are.  This poses many problems in that it is extremely unlikely that any sort of agreements can be shared about how to define these two ideas or even what words can be agreed upon and used that would cross or translate between any of them.  

This is the first issue raised in Chapter 5, and Fulbrook gives a really brilliant example of how there can never truly be generally agreed upon categories or concepts in social sciences.  She illustrates this by pointing out the Periodic Table of Elements and how the values of the elements listed in the table are agreed upon by all scientists without exception.  

This is not the case for historical theory or categorization in the slightest.  Fulbrook reiterates that all historians use some form of categorization or conceptualization in their research and it is inherent to the very practice of “doing” history.  Various tenets of individual beliefs, the sway of political ideals, and judging the past by the terms of the present are all invariably part of various concepts that are visible in historical practice.  

All of these concepts have their own followers and arguments they present.  These include how to define what categories to use in terms of discussing historical events of the past.  How does the view of immanence control these conceptual frameworks so that no other views can be accounted for?  Historians also do not always necessarily accept each other’s premises of new or “original” research concepts/categories, and this further perpetuates the idea that particular frameworks are the only acceptable means to utilize. 

Fulbrook states that concepts and categories cannot be escaped, but she pushes for the idea that they be shared and translated among and within all of the various competing notions.  Being explicitly clear about terminology and lessening the rigidity of particular theory can aid in encouraging open-mindedness and allow for shared concepts and categories.  


Sources of evidence are also interpreted differently, and Fulbrook argues that this is because of individual historians and their own paradigms, frameworks and ability (or discomfort) to “fill in the gaps” in historical narratives (emplotments).  

She reiterates that sources are the foundational blocks of historical thought, and that source criticism is how historical ideas are evaluated.  The historians that she specifically names (Elton, Tosh, Jordanova, Morley, and Evans) all agree to this concept.  That in itself is quite amazing, and I wonder if that could actually be the historian’s Periodic Table of the Elements (just as a basic touchstone for what constitutes actual historical practice, not in how sources are interpreted or used, there’s always a catch).  

But (of course there is a but in this), historians will evaluate, interpret and render conclusions of sources based on the frameworks and paradigms in which they operate.  Because humans are interpreting their present conditions on a daily basis, we are inherently able to do the same with textual references.  This is then applied to our own individual framework as we attempt to “work out” how to identify and evaluate the present.  Fulbrook writes that this is the same thing we do with evidence from the past.

Simply posing hypothetical questions with regard to a particular subject, as stated by Fulbrook, means that the available sources related to that overarching historical event, etc.….. are going to be chosen with particular reference to the hypothetical posed.  Essentially, we choose sources that can be used or interpreted in such a way that either reinforce or repudiate our posed hypothetical questions. 

Fulbrook cites specific examples of such methodology, with references to the events of the French Revolution, Hitler and the Holocaust, and Comparative History.  Each of these theoretical studies render very different and mostly divergent patterns of source interpretation; namely the events described all relate to either social, political or economic causes.  

The problems that arise with this are in the wide variety of interpretation given with the same sources.  Fulbrook’s entire argument regarding sources and source criticism hinge on the idea that because of our individual ideals, frameworks, paradigms, hypothetical questionings, and ultimate emplotments, the same sources produce wildly differing results.  She always urges for an understanding of how these concepts conflict and also how these conflicting ideas can be “translated” across frameworks, paradigms, etc. ….. in order to broaden the topic.  Although, I am still unclear as to how she proposes this could occur.

*Questions-*

Are varying categories and concepts always going to inherently conflict?  What if they did not?

How can source criticism be used to create a fusion of historical paradigms and frameworks?
