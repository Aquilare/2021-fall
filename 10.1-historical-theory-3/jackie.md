## Labeling the Parts and Looking for Clues

There have been innumerous ways in which historians have studied the past, just as there have been innumerous arguments about which of those methods of study has proven to be the most *correct* or most representative of what historical thought and practice *should* be. Chapter five and six of Fulbrook's book dives into this *how* of historical method and theory. 

To me, both chapters make up the bones of the books overall argument. Fulbrook, explicit from the beginning, really hashes out her argument that all historians, always, work within specific paradigms, theories, and conceptual frameworks. This is an inevitability. Even if you think you do not, or are blissfully or otherwise ignorant to it, you do. It is absolute. 

These concepts, which are primarily social in nature permeate though everything, and yet, unlike scientific concepts, they are not universally understood and agreed upon. For example, it is certain that two historians will study the same topic within the bounds of the same conceptual framework, (such as gender identity, for instance) however, the outcome of their interpretations will be dramatically different based on their presupposed notions of particular vocabulary, bias, context, etc. 

Fulbrook argues that, historians are more or less working towards the same end, to use evidence to analyze and understand the past. Exactly *how* that is done is clearly up for debate, and Fulbrook posits that there is very clearly a spectrum. Historical conceptual frameworks, methodologies, and analytical categories fall on a spectrum, and by making that spectrum more accessible, the historical possibilities open up. 

In chapter six, sources and evidence, and *how* historians can and do use them are discussed.
