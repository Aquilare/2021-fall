# Reflections on Fulbrook, Historical Theory III

Fulbrook opens Chapter 5 with the assertion that, as hard as they might try, historians can never truly escape the use of concepts and categories, those being the selective filters through which the doing of history is characterized. Fulbrook later equates concepts and categories to a fishing net which impacts both what historians catch (the exact stories they tell and sources to justify those stories) as well as shape our conception of an unseen world (generate a working understanding of what the past was like according to x,y, or z)

Even before one selects sources to analyze, they must have some understanding of the past is comprised of. Fulbrook notes how in the natural sciences, categories for analysis (periodic elements, atoms, classification of geological rocks, etc.) are generally agreed upon and considered to be existing realities regardless of our awareness of them or precise labeling of them. In contrast, all historical categorization and conceptualization is the product of a set of subjective assumptions made on the part of the historian about the world and about the past. Thus the Rankian notion of detailing the past “as it was” is something of an unattainable ideal, as all language describing the past will inevitably be colored by the particular paradigms and frameworks historians operate under. 

Interestingly, Fulbrook notes how the issues inherent in the categorization of history extends far behind that field alone, and in fact shape much of contemporary political discourse. Consider the often-discussed categories of race, class, gender, national background, or religion. Some thinkers may envision these categories as being fixed aspects of an existing reality, while others would contend that they are merely the result of various social and historical developments, and due to these competing views there is much contention within society over issues relating to these categories. So too has there been significant contention among historians over competing categorizations and conceptualization, to which some historians have encouraged a shared, universal means of conceptualization. 

One of the methods of creating a somewhat shared conceptualization is what Fulbrook refers to as “anachronistic concepts,” which in practice attempt to treat the past as a foreign nation to which we in the present can reconstitute the past “in its own terms” so-to-speak. However, Fulbrook notes two issues with this approach. First, the very act of reconstituting the past involves subjective determinations about the way to characterize history and the precise events, people, or places to focus on. Second, the past, like a foreign nation, is not a monolith which can be interrogated for a singular truth. Rather, both foreign nations and the past are a complex of distinct, competing perspectives, none of which fully characterize the whole by itself. 

Fulbrook then goes on to describe Max Weber’s notion of the “ideal types” – various theoretical constructions which act as a measuring rod by which to compare a historians findings to “reality.” I interpreted this being the historical equivalent of platonic forms, or theoretical, intangible ideas regarding of the reality of certain objects, and all empirically available forms of those objects being imperfect reflections of its platonic form. The purpose of introducing this construction is to provide everyone probing history with some sense of shared understanding by comparing their findings to the same ideal standard. Aside from this introducing an issue with being able to empirically verify historical claims, Weber’s notion of “ideal types” is denoted by Fulbrook as self-contradictory. Even theoretical constructions like the ideal type is predicated on specific assumptions about what is significant enough within history to be compared to. 

In lieu of creating a shared, universally acknowledged method of conceptualizing and categorizing history, Fulbrook instead encourages that historians be explicit about the subjective and particular concepts/categories they use to inform their work. Through honesty, we may be able to translate our historical languages and understand one another better. Rather than creating an artificial lingua franca for all historians to use, Fulbrook advocates that historians partake in a intersubjective discourse that reveals at once the assumptions historians have made about the past and the purpose for their particular conceptualization or categorization of history. 

Questions: 
1- Can source critcism itself be influenced by the subjective conceptualization of history? If so, how can we demonstrate the accuracy of certain historical claims? 

2 - If it was possible to do so, would it be desirable for historians to rally around a singular "morally nuetral" schema for categorizating and conceptualizing history?
