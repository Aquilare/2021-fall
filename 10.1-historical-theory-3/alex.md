### Historical Theroy 3
For chapter five what I got as the essence of what Fulbrook was attempting to get to was that you have to be very careful on how you use and name concepts because they are not a fixed thing like it is in sciences as with the table of elements, and you cannot escape from them. That over general concepts, like the Tudor revolution in government, gives too many assumptions to the time period that can limit the ways of the bigger picture. Another point that is brought up is another issue with concepts is that as the wider the social phenomena the more things become a “given” even when it is acknowledged that it is a social construct like gender and the nation. Now Fulbrook is not saying that concepts are bad but that in the further the concept get pulled from the groups that share the same understandings to groups that do not share those same understandings. An example that Fulbrook gives is the notion of strong authority which in some camps can be seen as a good thing but also can bring about the rise of a dictator. 

Another main point that I understood is that you do not have to always accept contemporary categories and can put their own views on what we think what happened even if the historical population could not see it. An example that was given was the people be accused of witchcraft and that was the reason. This has been rejected by modern historians, but the “truth” is still being debated any where from gender to social functionalism. That a historian should be wary of over-homogenous notions of a time period, and they need to have look at the period with an overview analytic vantage. A different type of concept that of one based in theory but these theory based concepts have an issue that they differ on what some categories are defined based on the theory’s assumptions this leads to a self-contradictory feature of the theory based looks that they are clearly defined but at the same time they have an implicit claim on being better at describing how the world works. That by using broader concepts you might be able to find some common grounds in different paradigms. 

### Chapter Six
When you look at sources there are many different aspects of a source that you have to think about who the author was, what was the source target audience, what sources reman and which have been destroyed, what type of sources are out there. And as a historian you have to interpret all of the information the sources have and are lacking in order to get an evaluation of the sources and the possibility of evaluating the source wrong and misinterpreting what is being written. That trying to understand the readings that have left behind you have to also be aware that humans are social beings that think about what happened yesterday what they are planning on doing for tomorrow. So, it is difficult to evaluate the text, but it is necessary to do.

Also, in the writing and looking at sources you have to look at what Fulbrook calls the intermediate layer between the sources and the historians’ account. Which she means looking at how the categories are used and how the empirical evidence can possibly be used to mend or revise concepts, explanatory frameworks, or theories. Over time it is the discourse of specific collective questions that have moved forward how sources have been used. Sources can be used even though they do not provide a “real” past can be debated about. 

Chapter six the main point I got was that you have to look at the intermediate layer. Where your strategies and explanations can be debated and amended in traditional methods.







### Questions 
Even if historians are able to agree on the definitions of concepts would this lead to a lessening of questions that would be asked about the past?

How much does historical investigation play a part in how useful sources are?
