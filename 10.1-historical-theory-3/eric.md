Fullbrook is giving the idea that the language one uses, is going to define how someone will try to answer a historical situation. Fullbrook is stating that words have different meanings and contexts, especially when trying to answer a historical question. 

Every historian will have a different way of tackling a historical problem and that becomes even more complicated when they are from a different nationality or political system. Fullbrook points to that fact that every society is going to understand words differently. For example, a person living under a dictatorship is not going to likely think they are living under a “evil” political system compared to one under a democratic republic.

I think her overall solution is to outright define and state what kind of answer the historian is trying find with their work. I am thinking of what people in the intelligence profession use when writing a longer paper. At the beginning the author will put a “scope note” that clearly defines what the paper is about and lets the reader know that the paper is not trying to answer any other questions but the ones that have been stated.

Fullbrook also wants to create a sort of neutral language that can used by historians. She does posit that it may not be completely possible to do so with all concepts but there may be some that can be agreed upon by a large majority. In essence, Fullbrook just wants to clear up confusion when about what a historian is writing.

Is finding a neutral language a worthwhile venture when those that disagree about a historical subject are not even going to acknowledge an idea outside of their own beliefs?
