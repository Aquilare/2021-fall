I think that concepts of time and progress are incredibly important in how people view history. 
When studying history people divide it up according to periods and movements, such as the Enlightenment or renaissance. 
Even though the dates and movements are not exact, making different time period for social or technological progresses helps people understand history. 

I think that studying history does help humanity progress, since it helps create a better understanding for societies about what was "then" like and what "now" is like.
I think that it can also help create more of a clear culture for people, since it creates a past history that leads to them.
Studying history could also imply a desire to learn from it, and help their own civilization or empire escape the pitfalls that befell the ones before them.

I think studying Augustine in this course is important, because it helps show what contemporary historians were trying to accomplish when they were writing their histories. 
He also very clearly was against the idea of a cyclical history, and insisted that history was linear according to Gods actions towards humandkind. 
He also argued that true happiness was based on spiritual conditions, not so much physical ones found in the "world to come". 

Lennon argues that the Greco-Roman histories follow a much more circular path, with everything ending and beginning again in some way. 
In contrast, Judeo-Christian histories follow a more linear persepective, with a beginning and a definite ending. 
Judeo-Christian hstories also feature many more apocolyptic events and ideas, as well as of course more religious themes than their counterparts.

1. How much did these histories affect contemporary public thought? How many people were literate in ancient Greece? 
2. How do we decide what is and isn't progress?
