How are conceptions of time and progress important to the meaning of history (even today)?

There are instances in which people at the aspects of nature have a meaningful relationship with one another, 
and that there is the concept of organic growth that constitutes in everything having a pre-programming path.

Does studying history imply it is to facilitate some kind of human “progress”?

I think in some aspects there is an implication of human “progress” because the reading is almost making it sound like progress will happen whether 
people fight against it or go along with it.

Why should we care about Augustine in a historiography course?

I think it's important to study Augustine and his beliefs because it constitutes what many have believed for centuries. 
He mentions how he doesn't believe in endlessly occurring historical cycles and how he believes that God was very aware of the world he
created and how it was beneficial for all of mankind. I think that's interesting to read and think about because it embodies the religion as a whole, 
that the body is inhabited by a spirit and that the spirit was created by God. 
It can then be doubted that the human will and position to do and say things were all foreseen and the human condition is pre-programmed.

How does Lemon think we should compare Greco-Roman vs. Christian histories?

There are comparisons between the pagan beliefs of the Romans to the Christian beliefs in what the meaning of progress and fate meant. For example there is the belief in the Roman eternal concept in which the Roman empire was supposed to be the fifth eternal, an empire to end all empires. The Christian belief was that God had bestowed the eternal powers onto his emrisy on Earth to end all wars and empires. How there were foreseen prophets of a cycle of growth and development and destruction, and that it is continuous and never ending.

What other ideas were especially interesting?

I thought that it was interesting that the concepts of time and fate were described with essentially two different definitions. 
The one in which fate and time are constructs of human nature and will, and the religious reasoning in which things happen because of the gods 
and entities of higher power.


Don’t forget your 1-2 INFORMED questions!

The reading suggested that Plato believed different definitions of what constitutes time and fate, 
and yet he didn't believe in it. What was this, and what did he believe in instead?
