Oneâ€™s viewpoint of time guides the way history is recorded and taught. A cyclical viewpoint is going to make certain events, achievements, or setbacks seem irrelevant to the understanding of history because they will happen again so no need to put emphasis on it or even write it down. It comes down to one historian believing that if they did not find it important in their time, it might be important the next time it happens. 

A linear approach will make almost everything important. Every single thing someone has done will have some kind of long term effect. We might not fully understand how they affected history but everyone has some part to play. It does not mean that a historian will need to record every action but it does mean every action helped move history one step further in time.

History does help facilitate history because as long as we remember most of the mistakes we have already made, we can make progress as a whole. The study of history has helped civilizations learn and build upon what others have done. People started creating history texts about what they had done to show how much better they did something than the last person and have continued to do so ever since.

Augustine gives a differing and what appears to be one of the first understandings of how to think about a linear history. This linear thought teaches that people are moving towards something in time, for Augustine something good and otherworldly. For others, we can take that idea to study how we are moving in time and why we got there.

Lemon thinks that we should compare Greco-Romans and Christians on how they viewed time. Christians believe that God only created one time so everything to going to come to an end when God decides to end it. The Greco-Romans were more of the cyclical nature and that everything repeats itself. 

Did Greco-Romans believe in cyclical history because they only knew of a small part of the world?
