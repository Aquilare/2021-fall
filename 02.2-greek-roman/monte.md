## The Tale of Two Cities

What an unearthly (*haha!*) amount of thought to unpack. When considering time and progress we often correlate them into one single neat package. In most standards time = progress. That could be me instinctually seeing the world in a linear fashion. Heading toward an end point of absolute utopia or absolute destruction depending on what end you subscribe to. Even now we measure everything by progress (technological, social, and political) which equates to history. We haven’t even escaped the thought of believing we are at the forefront. Gone are the golden age, the gilded age, and revolutions (such as the industrial.) We are the **modern age.** What does this mean?

In studying history we all are told a pleasant story which might as well be a nursery rhyme at this point. We study history to learn from the past and avoid mistakes. Do we? Or is a trajectory we track to see the advancement of ideas and creations? Or does it simply depend on the individual entirely. I think human nature often can dictate how that history is used whether learned or not. 

Augustine was an interesting choice for the course. It wasn’t just his own writing and ideas that caused my self reflection. Lemon’s weaving of what came before and after is what I found so interesting. This style of thinking of the ultimate good and the linear path were a direct challenge to the Graeco-Roman thinking of cyclical *phoenix-style* rebirth of history. I think he shows us how “progress” can play out.

Would we consider this progress? If we look at what came after? A multitude of different understandings on what Augustine meant. Several thinkers, historians, or politicians who explained to the common man what Augustine *“really meant”*. Expanding or changing, questioning, and molding these seem like lessons on progress to me. 

Lemon provides a view from different points of view and shows us the varying ideas of the Graeco-Roman belief of the repeating history vs the Christian linear line of history. Even within the two thought lines many differences arose from different thinkers. Does history matter? Should we care about the “earthly city”? Lemon wants us (I believe) to examine the different ideas critically. However, realize that flaws can be found in both as well as merits. 

It’s comforting for people to recognize we have “come so far”. So measurable progress is often beneficial from a nation's point of view, especially when that nation wants to take some credit for that particular progress. The idea of why Greece and why Athens was very interesting, and doesn’t seem to have a clear answer. Why did all this thinking spring up from one place?

1. **Fate** and **chance** played a part within the Graeco-Roman idea of history. Why then the clear cyclical path of returning to the present? Could it derail into something else entirely?
2. The idea that history is **irrelevant**, can this mean some history is more relevant then others? Who decides this and why?


Monte got the authors (Lemon) name right this time. **That is progress.**
