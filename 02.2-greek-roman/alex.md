### Time and Progress
Time and progress are important to the meaning of history because I believe that it makes history easier to understand history for the majority of readers. The importance of time lets the historian put a starting and ending point to what they are talking about.

 Progress is the easiest way for a historian to keep the reader engaged with it. Now how we show we have progressed, either through the circular way like the Greco-Romans or liner does not matter. Progress helps give purpose to history showing that even if current times are rough we have progressed so far and gives the reader hope that we will continue to progress. 
 
### Does studying history facilitate some kind of human “progress”?
I think studying history does facilitate human progress because it is an easy way to organize the past because people tend to like things to be tidy and show a natural growth. With this growth it helps the readers of history to believe that their daily life is better than it was in the past. For example, how modern time has “progressed” more than preindustrial time and so on. 

### Augustine
Augustine is important to a historiography course because he the first major well-read historian that had changed the idea of history from being one of times of cycles to liner timeline. Now whether the argument of if Augustine thought that history was important or not is still open for argument. 

This means that Augustine is a good example of how the idea of how history is written and changed is not a relatively a new idea and he also shows that the idea of what history is can change suddenly. 

### Greco-Roman Vs. Christian histories
I think that Lemon’s base idea was the fact that Greco-Roman is all about how cycles and the Rise and fall of empires and city-states and the idea that time is endless because of the idea of cycles. While the Christian idea is more liner and the fact that time has a beginning and an end. 

The other idea I think Lemon want to show that Greco-Roman with there cyclical idea of history shows that they thought that history was less meaningful because nothing changes, and everything will repeat. For Christians the opposite is true that history is meaningful because in the eyes of Christians, the past is all part of God’s plan. 
### Questions
If Lemon stated that Christians overall believe that history is meaningful, why then is there an argument on if Augustine thought history had meaning or not?

Would the Graco- Roman ideology work to explain current civilization? And if so, how could one use the idea of cycles to see where in the cycle they currently are at?
