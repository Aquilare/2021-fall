  How are conceptions of time and progress important to the meaning of history (even today)? 
As we saw in the reading there were a few different interpretations with the concepts of time and progress and what they meant to the Greco Romans thought with time as I cyclical and later how Judeo Christians thought that time followed a linear path. Even today I think that these types of debates are being had and these questions are being asked in popular culture like in the first season of True Detective on HBO where Matthew McConaughey makes the statement “Time is a flat circle” the readings bout how past civilizations thought about time and progress made me think of pop culture more than once in the reading. 
  
Does studying history imply it is to facilitate some kind of human “progress”? 
	I think yes that studying History does lead to the facilitation of progress it’s a way to help make sense of the world and get a grasp on where we have been to get to where we need to go. how I think that some Greco Roman interpretations of History being a function of biology where we are born we reach maturity and eventually decay and die recognize that there is progress in that span of time. 	
 

 Why should we care about Augustine in a historiography course? 
	We should care about Augustine because of the ideas that he put forth that are not limited to the confines of the church or its leaders. Augustine challenged the Greco Roman belief that time was cyclical and things are just going to keep repeating themselves. Augustine put forth the idea that time was linear that we are constantly moving forward that we are continually evolving and are progressing. I like that Augustine also put an emphasis on being reasonable “ he insisted that rationality and purpose therefore infused the whole of Creation, both in its physical and its temporal ordering” (Lemon, 55) He made the distinction that was unfolding wasn’t cyclical that its important and matters in the greater scheme of things. 
 

 How does Lemon think we should compare Greco-Roman vs. Christian histories? 
	I think that Lemon was trying to choose sides that much with regards to Greco Roman vs Christians Histories. He instead lays out in painstaking detail how each view on History came to be and in the Judeo Christian came to be within the scope of the Roman world. I think that Lemon wanted us be able to distinguish each view of History and how both can be useful in our own study and interpretation of History. 
  

What other ideas were especially interesting? 
	I thought the concepts of “Fate” and “Fortune” were especially interesting in the Greco Roman world and how later on they ascribed fate as to the will of the Gods or the Gods themselves and Fortune was a moral force that was rewarded or punished people or nation states by their deeds.
 

 Don’t forget your 1-2 INFORMED questions!
	I was thinking about how one of the tenets of Christianity is to spread the message of the gospel and to go out and evangelize and that was a big part  why Augustine and his theories on a linear history were able to spread through a Roman world. Well I was wondering what if Christianity didn’t emphasize evangelization? Would the idea that History was linear have caught on? Would it have mattered that it was from a religion that wasn’t interested in evangelization of the world?
