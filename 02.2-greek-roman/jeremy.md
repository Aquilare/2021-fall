  How are conceptions of time and progress important to the meaning of history (even today)? 

As we saw in the reading there were a few different interpretations with the concepts of time and progress and what they meant to the Greco Romans and how they thought of time as cyclical and later how Judeo Christians thought that time followed a linear path. Even today I think that these types of debates are being had and these questions are being asked in popular culture like in the first season of True Detective on HBO where Matthew McConaughey makes the statement “time is a flat circle” meaning that time keeps repeating itself over and over again like the cyclical thinking of the Greco Romans. The readings about how past civilizations thought about time and progress made me think of pop culture more than once in the reading. 
  
Does studying history imply it is to facilitate some kind of human “progress”? 
	
  I think yes that studying History does lead to the facilitation of progress. It’s a way to help make sense of the world and get a grasp on where we have been in able  to get to where we need to go. I think that the Greco Roman interpretation of History being a function of biology where we are born, reach maturity, and eventually decay and die recognize that there is progress in that span of time and much can be learned for future generations. 
 

 Why should we care about Augustine in a historiography course? 
	
  We should care about Augustine because of the ideas that he put forth are not limited to the confines of the church or its leaders. Augustine challenged the Greco Roman belief that time was cyclical and things are just going to keep repeating themselves. Augustine put forth the idea that time was linear that we are constantly moving forward that we are continually evolving and are progressing. I like that Augustine also put an emphasis on being reasonable “he insisted that rationality and purpose therefore infused the whole of Creation, both in its physical and its temporal ordering” (Lemon, 55) He made the distinction that world events that were unfolding weren’t cyclical that it was important and mattered in the greater scheme of things. 
 

 How does Lemon think we should compare Greco-Roman vs. Christian histories? 
	
  I think that Lemon wasn’t trying to choose sides with regards to Greco Roman vs Christians interpretations and thoughts on History. He instead lays out in painstaking detail how each view on History came to be and how the Judeo Christians ideas on linear history came to be within the scope of the Roman world. I think that Lemon wanted us to be able to distinguish each view of History and how both can be useful in our own study and interpretation of History. 
  

What other ideas were especially interesting? 
	
  I thought the concepts of “Fate” and “Fortune” were especially interesting in the Greco Roman world and how later on they ascribed "Fate" as to the will of the Gods or the Gods themselves and "Fortune" was a moral force that rewarded or punished people or nation states by their deeds.
 

 Don’t forget your 1-2 INFORMED questions!
	
  I was thinking about how one of the tenets of Christianity is to spread the message of the gospel and to go out and evangelize and that was a big part why Augustine and his theories on a linear history were able to spread through a Roman world. Well I was wondering what if Christianity didn’t emphasize evangelization? Would the idea that History was linear have caught on? Would it have mattered that it was from a religion that wasn’t interested in evangelizing the world?
