Clearly the concept of time has had a large impact on the self-image of humanity. In the reading they discuss the view of many Greek Philosophers; essentially that time runs in a cyclical fashion which can be applied to all things. This was the birth, life, Zenith, and eventual death of everything physical and even more abstract concepts such as the cosmos. Obviously progress plays into this cyclical view of the universe given that something must make progress to continue from “childhood” to “adulthood.” In doing so one can see how we might be better than those that came before us in many senses such as technology, philosophy, or in most any way. In that way, progress is important in history in that it marks milestones in society which we can often view and use to criticize the past. Just as Aristotle and Plato looked back and tribal and village-based societies from their city-state ones; we look back at them from our national or even global based societies. Continuing this line of thought leads to the question of how future societies would be view our current time, having what is far less technological or philosophical advancements? 

 

Studying history does indeed imply some form of human progress. The question is what we mean by “progress.” History clearly doesn’t let us advance technology or build new super computers. It does, however, allow us to advance in terms of understanding the reason certain things happened and hopefully lead us to predict the future as well. In a more literal sense, History could of course be seen merely as a timeline of advancements made by humans throughout time.  

 

I believe we should care about Augustine in a histography course for the same reason we care about Plato, or any other historian. Each one offers their “History” from their perspective, morals, and societal norms. Just as the Greeks offered history from a societal view with deep-rooted belief that the pantheon of Gods existed, and unimaginable lingo and socio-political references that we will never understand so too did Augustine offer his history from his own views.  

 

I think that Lemon seeks to show us that both Greco-Roman and Christian societies saw themselves as the Zenith of human advancement, Rome in that it thought it would be a never-ending society and Christians in that they were the ones to inherit the Earth through faith. In that way they are similar, and yet they are both different in that Greco-Romans clearly had a more cyclical view of history whereas Christian societies believed in a more linear pathway for history.  

 

I personally found the concept that every society believed themselves to be the peak of human innovation and intelligence to be under explored. I suppose it's in the human mindset to place yourself at the peak of possibility due to pride. 

 

1) Have any cultures seen themselves as the beginning of innovation, or to be in the early stages of development? 

 

2) Could Greco-Roman cyclical histories be applied to the more modern day such as the rise and fall of the British Empire and maybe even serve to pinpoint where in the cycle we fall in the modern day?
