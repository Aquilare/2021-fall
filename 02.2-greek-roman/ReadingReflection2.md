Conceptions of time and progress are important to understanding history and historiography across the centuries for numerous reasons. While Lemon's explanations of historiographical philosophy are quite sizeable, it is rather straightforward to decipher that by understanding that people in the past viewed their own histories in a specific way, a clearer picture of those histories and how they advanced through time becomes available to us. 
By viewing history this way, whether that history is Greco-Roman, Judeo-Christian, or modern American, historians open themselves up to increased comprehension of the past. 

I believe, that although a highly subjective term, it is essentially out of the question to not progress. If you look at the definition of time, "the indefinite continued progress of existence and events in the past, present, and future regarded as a whole," progress is automatically included and is used concurrently with movement, not success. 

The study of history certainly facilitates this definition of progress in its objective form, but it also facilitates the meaning of progress in its countless subjective forms. Historians, and humans in general throughout time, have viewed the world through the lenses of their time period and that is likely not to change. Whether or not those views become more progressive, more conservative, more religious, more atheistic, it doesn't really matter. Viewpoints are bound to change and with them, what is deemed progress. 

Time can be viewed historically the same way, and is synchronous with the concept of progress, as seen in the above definition. While time is a much more concrete idea in modern times, it wasn't always the case, and realizing this while practicing historical study is essential. 

Augustine presents an important case study in history because his published beliefs causes something of a paradigm shift in how time was understood to be constructed. No longer were the cyclical, ever repeating timelines of the pagans accepted, but instead a linear and highly religious timeline was put in its place. 

In his own somewhat confusing and biased way, Augustine was a myth-buster who vocalized and made available an essential concept to the understanding of the Christian world during his time. 

In Lemon's readings, I particularly enjoyed the discussion regarding the concept of cyclical time. Parts of it make perfect sense when looking at it from a cosmic and natural world based viewpoint. What I couldn't fully grasp, but maybe will eventually, is why the Greeks thought that the entire universe would completely end and then start over with every person living a carbon copy existence. 

A few questions:
1. What sort of concepts about time and progress do you find most helpful when studying history? 
2. If you were an Greek person living in ancient times, do you think you would find history meaningless since the world was destined to repeat itself?
