The heaviness of Greco-Roman and Christian interpretations of time and progress permeate the Western Eurocentric views of how those labels are defined.  Lemon’s writings present the (as he terms it) “dichotomy” of these juxtaposed perspectives in a way that is completely dependent on the cultural and social nuances of the Greek and Roman civilizations, and in the religious beliefs of the Judeo-Christian theologies.

Measurements of time define how the Greco-Roman historical philosophies differ from the Judeo-Christian viewpoints in that the former is modeled on the tenets of cyclical/biological values and the latter moves in a linear format from a certain origin point forward.  Both ideals, whether they acknowledge the human capabilities of “progress” or not, are completely **dependent** on a sense of time, however that may be measured.  

This sense of time is exactly how our modern perspective of history is defined today.  Historical research is presented largely in part on what time (in our own culturally-dependent definition of such) an event took place or a person ruled, was born or died.  
The idea of time in a modern sense is also dependent on scientific and mathematical definitions, and those factors obviously did not influence thinkers in late antiquity.

Invariably, humans need to label things to gain a sense of familiarity with them, and this is part of why time and the ideas of progress (in present terms) create the basis for modern historical thought.  However, this should not be taken as the need to define modern historical ideals as those being used to study human progress alone. 

Rather, the study of history should encompass the display of the complexities of human nature and behavior, not simply in terms of progress, but of any critical components of whatever might be necessary to understand or gain a more complete picture of the human condition.

Any Medievalist will say that grasping the completely ambiguous ideologies of St. Augustine is necessary to understanding how the Medieval Christian world functioned, to varying degrees.  His writings on the origins of evil and the temporal and sacred worlds are frustratingly vague and confounding.  Yet, many Medieval societies and intellectuals of the time were greatly influenced by his ideas and modern historians are, therefore, relegated to understand that influence (for better or worse).

Another interesting point that Lemon made was in trying to relate the “where” and “why” the shift in thinking occurred in early Greek philosophies of history.  Greek society, given their high degree of intellectual latitude, was changing in such a way that allowed for the somewhat atheistic perspectives of important philosophers to develop.  This is critical in the idea of being able to divorce oneself from the notion that history has to be **interdependent** on religious thought rather than allowing it to exist on its own merits.

*Further thoughts:*

Why are Judeo-Christian ideals of historical philosophy seemingly related to one another, despite their rather overt cultural differences?

Should “progress” be the hallmark of whether or not a specific culture or society is worthy of historical significance and research?
