### “We’re Gonna Need A Bigger Reflection”
  -*Jaws (sort of)*

A journey through history would be about how you imagine it. We start with the earliest thinkers on the subjects and continue through each coinciding change in the historical roadmap. That’s exactly what we did. Doing this we can measure the changes from one era into the next. The cultural, religious, and political explanations each period of historians gravitated toward helped challenge the next group and so on.

**The Greeks** brought us a poetic history and the idea of the gods ever determining the fate of humans and events. Allowing this to explain the causes, while also subscribing to a cyclical style of history. A never ending pattern that would explain what happened, as it would happen again soon enough. This allowed the Greeks to explain the unexplainable.

I enjoyed the idea of the water cycle approach to government. Even this early history and this cyclical idea was used in politics. The king gives way to the oligarchy, which then moves into a democracy, then into anarchy, and finally back into a king. We will see politics and religion almost intertwined with the study of history.

When the Greeks' power waned and gave way to **the Romans** the lines of thinking changed. The Romans were the fourth (or fifth) city and a break from the pattern. They were the end or so they believed. We also see the departure from the gods manufacturing every event. While still religiously inspired, the Romans didn’t shy away from taking credit. We see the start of humans changing history although still fate inspired.

This pattern or cyclical history was challenged with the rise of the **Christian church**. Religious historians and writers saw history not as a continuous circle but a linear path with a start and finish. Augustine even painted the picture of two cities. This city or earthly city was just to be witnessed or passed through on the way to the heavenly city. In a way we see the religiously inspired history make a comeback. As it was God who made all things happen that included forward progress. 

The church and the feudal system leaders would carry on this idea of God inspired history and a stark contrast came first when the Renaissance period ,as the name states, renewed itself. In this **Early Modern period** we see a push back on previous ideas. History with writers like Machivelli depart from philosophical ideas and try to become more practical and useful in other arenas such as economics and politics. Swirling alongside these thoughts is the protestant reformation which challenged the idea of a figure in the middle. Thanks to the printing press going strong. Everyone can now  read history and everyone can read the bible, in some ways they went hand in hand. We see early pushback on feudal and church leadership.

The idea that someone could change one’s fortune with history. Learn from the past and you could make a better future. This idea still exists today. Why do we study history, many will say if we don’t we are doomed to repeat it. That may be up for debate but the idea that this sort of thinking had carried on surely isn’t. History at this point was still very matter of fact. Despite being honed to be more professional, it still lacked many of the characteristics we see today in scholarly history.

The **Enlightenment period** that sparked after these drastic changes harkened back to the Greco-Roman ideas, art, and even celebration of famous writers from these periods. However, the Enlightenment  thinkers believed they had not only taken up the Roman torch but surpassed them. With scientific thinking they began viewing history as a tool or a function. It could be wielded and used in conversation to make a point, or refute one. Despite an effort to depart from the previous period many still viewed historical progress through a linear model. 

When viewing people from areas of colonization they believed that tribes and indegenious people simply hadn’t reached the point of civilization they had. A simple view was that humans followed the pattern of hunter, pastoral, agricultural, and then commercial. Allowing the European thinkers to view everyone on earth through a Eurocentric lense. Everything, even civilization, had a start and an end point.

Contrary to what they and many before though, things continued to change. In fact one of the major ideas of the **Romanticism** period was directly pushing back on the ideas of the Enlightenment. Even as far as stealing the idea of being a light. Romanticism was the light and the Enlightenment way of thinking was just a mirror. In this period we see a deeper introspection on the individual. Celebration and illumination of the uniqueness.
	
In this period we also see a pull back toward previous ideas. Critical history was a rebound from the idea of history being a science. Footnotes, citations, and good resources. Hard dates and precise information harkened back to the early modern period and even hints at the Roman idea of human focus with a departure on embellishment of course.

The opposite idea was Romantic history. A history that bends detail for a good narrative. This reminded me of the Greek storytelling and even the bravado of the Romans, what tells the best story? We see both of these styles used throughout the different periods but now it seemed they were separated to be explained, however, I think it’s clear we need both to weave an entertaining and accurate historical tapestry.

We even see history under Leopold Von Ranke studied just for the sake of being studied. They are stories that need to be told, so we should tell them. This isn’t an idea that was common, as we see several instances of writers, scholars, and historians trying to determine the proper use for history. Is it practical, is it professional, is it explaining nations, or is it simply just...**history?** 

1. *Does the study of history change with the ideas of the period, or does the period change because of how we view history?*
2. *Does religion still play a part in historical study? Or has history departed from religious thinking entirely?*
