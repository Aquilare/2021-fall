Mary Fullbrook poses a question on whether historical accounts should be viewed as a matter of perspective which I believe to be mostly true. Most people, in this case historians, can all agree on certain “facts” as true but can interpret them in wildly different way. Germany during WWII was a perfect example used by Fullbrook to show how there can be different perspectives on the same events most consider to be true. 

The empirical approach to history involves using a scientific method to figure out the past. Empirical historians use evidence such as texts, usually from an archive, to reconstruct the past. Empirical historians are attempting to show people “how it was” using evidence but while also having to make inferences to what that historian thinks it was actually like and how history fits into a “grand narrative”.

Postmodernism challenges the empiricists by agreeing that an event has happened but there are many different stories to tell. Not every event occurs to all people in the same way which breaks with the empiricist view that everything fits into a single narrative.

This is not exactly answering the questions posed but I must say one of the quotes by Appley, Hunt, and Jacobs (page 23) was one of the most revelatory ideas I got from the chapters. I feel they are challenging what it is to be a historian by basically calling historians literature writers that have to create an air of authenticity to make their writing be taken seriously. I do think they are necessarily wrong, in the sense that historians have to create a narrative using the available evidence but are trying to demean what it is be a historian.

Paradigms for historians are how to approach studying a history. There are different ways to get to the same answer that people will agree on, but people will put more credence to certain ways of figuring out the answer above the others.

Can a smaller postmodern history not fit into the larger empirical history? Or are there too many little ones that will drown out the whole?
