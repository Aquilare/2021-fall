# Historical Faith


I don’t think I’d ever considered the faith it takes to study history. Historians construct a story from several pieces of a puzzle, not simply retell a story they have heard. Why was this story told? Who told it? When? Who is mentioned? Who isn’t? In some ways as mentioned “*the **‘truth’** could not only never be known, but was itself merely an article of faith*”(3). So what separates myth from history.

At first this seems like a simple question. Well we know what is history and what is myth. In the simplest terms myth was an attempt to explain the unexplainable while history can be proven, sourced, or referenced. It’s that simple. Or is it?

The idea that major dates could be agreed on but not the explanation or interpretation was fascinating. We see that in history even now. In an increasingly polarized society we often agree or disagree on what historical figures or events meant. Does that mean they are all just perspectives as Fulbrook inquiries? Or is one right and the rest wrong. Surely everything must have happened for some reason, is it the goal of the historian to explore the why or simply report the event?

However later in the chapter Fulbrook explains that it’s not the intention of this book to argue or debate the approaches in historical narratives. Writing “*perspectives in history are not - or not only - about the personal or political viewpoints of the individual historian*” (33). I think that often becomes a major focus and surely can’t/shouldn’t be ignored. The argument doesn’t exclude these biases but points out that a major theoretical “net”.

The really interesting point as these theories or paradigms are laid out is the overarching idea. Even if you refute these **paradigms**, or have no interest in theory. You just want to as the book says “just do history” you can’t escape and according to Fulbrook are living within the paradigms. A single historical story can be told in many different ways, are any of them right or are any wrong?

1. *How should history be structured in an academic setting? Should any and all forms of narrative be used or should a single structured “universal” way exist?*
2. *Is history becoming more biased?*
