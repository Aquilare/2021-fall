### Historical Theroy 1
One point that was a good recap for me was the importance of the “linguistic turn” and that the “truth” could not know and may different interpretation of the past exist. That because like the author metaphor on the tree. That it can be the same tree at a different angle or lens, or it could be a completely different tree that they are looking at.  Another point that was clarified was the complete polarization between historians. That you were either in the Postmodernism camp or you were in the empirical camp and neither seems to want to back down or take a look inward into their respective camps. The amount of polarization between the camps reminds me of the current political climate where your either them or us and there is no middle ground. 

Empirical approach to history is that the past cannot be truly known and what we know are reconstructions from evidence we currently have. Empirical camp of history believes that history is cumulative and that they go into archives and do historical research and try to see if there is some forgotten evidence that can help tell a more rounded depiction of what has happened in the past. The postmodernist challenge as I read it is the unease of the relationships between literature and history and the fact of challenging studying history at all. Which this comes back to the major question of the class this semester of what is history for. If all the historical writing carries the same weight, then why continue to study history. One way that these groups have failed to reconcile is that fir the empirical camp they have failed to see that even they use theories that they normally are saying that they do not like using. The issue for the postmodernist is that as Mary Fullbrook stated, “Part of the problem with postmodernist attacks on their particular construction of ‘naïve empiricism’ is that they have tended to focus on just one particular version of ‘doing history’…” (pg. 37).

A paradigm as far as a historian is concerned a way to frame their writings and how they do their research. They can also help ask what type of questions the historian ask. Mary Fullbrook identifies four different paradigms. Implicit paradigms can be summarized as unseen factors that shape the way a historian writes and does research which normally has a political skew which one is unaware of. The second one is perspectival paradigms which they normally differentiate on theoretical and contextual matters but normally agree on the metatheoretical matter. Meaning that they can seem to complement each other. Paradigms proper is the third and they have no commonality on theoretical contextual matters or metatheoretical matters. The last is Pidgin paradigms which share a common metatheoretical modes and also are more likely to talk and or borrow from other paradigms theoretical and contextual matters. The reason that paradigms are important to Fullbrook is that there is no way to escape from the paradigms and that you need to be able to see them be able to work together and be able to see that everyone uses them if they like it or not. 







### Questions 
In your studies which paradigm do you tend to use more?

Is there a way for the Empirical camp and the postmodern camp to work together and make a new paradigm?
