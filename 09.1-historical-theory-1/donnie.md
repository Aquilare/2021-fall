# Understanding the Past Through Perspective 


In reading Fulbrook’s proposal that clear understanding of historical events is sought from perspective gives a better understanding to the pursuit of empirical truth that we hope to find as historians within the dusty corners of past events. Historians take the evidence at hand and construct a story from the perspective of both the evidence at hand, and the angle of the story being sought. 

While the search for what happened as matters of fact were the building blocks that led to the study of history becoming an acceptable academic discipline, this very search for so called empirical truth drove divisions in society. Taking for example the different research questions of any event, one could gather all the viewpoints to create a kaleidoscope of perspectives. Thus, making perspectives one of many truths that taken together could create a patch work story. Perhaps giving truth and history something of an abstract nature. 

Fulbrook brings up a good question, if historians agree on facts but are unable to come up with a cohesive narrative, are we to then just look at all historical accounts as merely a perspective of the historian? (p 9) This could add to the clarity just as easily as it could murk up the waters. Thus, we get the postmodernist challenge. 

Postmodern has the job of trying to piece together a story that was never lived yet needs to be reflective of the time. Without knowing or understanding the motives of the past it is difficult to construct a truly accurate picture of the past. This seems to be the point Fulbrook is making when exploring the theories of historian Keith Jenkins who proclaimed, “understanding is always positioned, is always fabricated, is always self-referencing,” seems to suggest that in order tom understand fully we need motivational understanding that can not be found now within the evidence left behind. (p 20) Thus, we live with historical views in this postmodern time. 

We thus have the paradigm of truth within the gathering of information and relaying a proper interpretation of the past through these fragments of evidence. Pieces of empirical evidence that are viewed through different perspectives and each relay that elusive hope of all, to find out what happened. We have a puzzle, a patchwork quilt, of the past through the focus on individual paradigms, or angles of truth, to work with as historians. Both in understanding works of others and putting forth our own research. 

If we want to separate theory of what happened to actual events, we have Implicit history. The Civil War took place between 1861-1864. That we know. Battles and events are known, theories of motivations keep historians awake still. 

A new approach to history gives us all that we look to do now, bring in a perspective paradigm to the stories of the past that could lead us into the proper paradigm, or the actual change that took place because of the events lived and studied. 





- Is our picture of the past more clear, or are we less able to understand actual events of the past? 
- Are we bringing the past together in a clearer way now by diversifying approaches to historiography?
