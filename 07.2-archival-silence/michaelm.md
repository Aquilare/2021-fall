The easiest method for an archivist to grapple with the possibility of gaps in the record is probably to look at citizen-state interactions and examine the active marginalization of groups and individuals by powerful institutions. Repression is often documented, I imagine, as a means by which to legitimize the action by couching it in formal bureaucratic language and euphemism.

The idea of silence in the archives as power in itself is a striking subversion. Marginalized peoples can choose to deny their records to the dominant archive as an act of resistance. This can be a powerful tool, especially if their records are being demanded. By refusing access it frustrates the dominant party, forcing them to come to terms with the silence, this time a silence imposed on them instead of the other way around. It forces them to account for the silence, to worry about closing the record gap, and to attempt to reopen negotiation or conversation.

Marginalized peoples can create their own archives, either in opposition to the dominant archive or as an adjunct, or simply as an extra repository, one made to amplify and preserve the history of only a certain group.

The idea of “listening to silences” appears to me to be an obvious one. The archives should continuously be interrogated for gaps in the records as a matter of course and not just in attempts to find missing marginalized histories.

If marginalized people can choose to opt-out of record-keeping altogether, what does that mean for the integrity of the archive? Will there always be fundamentally unknowable gaps?
