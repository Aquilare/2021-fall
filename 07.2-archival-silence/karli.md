Archival “silence” is a *complex and complicated issue*, and based on the article/reading for today, there are no clear answers on how to solve it.  Not to mention, Carter states that there may be little to no solutions available either.  He also makes the case that “silences” in the archive may not even be a problem and are instead a deliberate void on the part of a particular group or persons that *do not want to participate* in archiving information in general.

I had never really considered that some silences are intentional, and could actually be a method of preserving power and cultural identity.  Despite the ideas of power over others and in non-compliance with the hegemony of a particular overarching structure (government, the state, religious institutions, etc.…), I still feel it is important to include all willing voices into a archive, no matter how they are perceived.

The illustrate my point, I will mention that there are archives in hierarchical institutions (i.e., museums, academic repositories and so forth) that pertain to individuals who are less than valued in their social contexts.  Some examples of these seemingly undervalued narratives belong to far-right American neo-Nazis and serial killers. 

**Should these voices be silenced?**  

What is the value of having these narratives in an archive?  I would argue that many researchers, not just historians, would find these archives of some value, despite the revulsion of the record makers.  

Referring back to our class discussion earlier this week, mentions of “agendas” in both archives and museums were brought up again and again.  The objectivity of the archivist is critical, despite the proclivity of human nature to allow biases and emotion to intrude in what is considered a scientific process (accessing records for their archival values).  This is exactly what we have mentioned in terms of writing and studying history in general.

**NO** – objective truths are not always possible (in fact, nearly improbable), but the work towards those ideals is what’s critical to both the archival and historical professions.

Most *progressive* museums and other cultural institutions are aware of their roles in excluding and minimalizing the silenced groups or voices in their communities.  This is why so many of these institutions are committed to community-outreach and in redressing the damage created by these archival silences.  This is a great point that Carter makes as well.  

Carter also brilliantly points out that not all archives need to exist in these cultural or hierarchical institutions either.  He gave examples of the Canadian Women’s Movement Archives and the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives as some of these independently created and curated repositories, which are squashing the silences within the archives around these particular groups.

*For Further Thought:*

Is the archival silence of a group, as Carter describes, always bound to be hidden from history?

Why would a group or culture (other than for conservation of individual power) choose to be silent in the archive?
