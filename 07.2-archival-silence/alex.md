### Archives Silence
One of the things I found interesting is the fact that the article states that there can not be speech without silence and that they are dependent on each other. And how that what is left unsaid actually determines what is stated or the story that is waiting to be told. Which goes with how one can know that a voice has been silenced because if you do not know if a voice has been silenced how do you know that they actually existed and how that you have to read against the grain of the archives to see the groups that have been silenced just how Female historians have done to be able to find out that they were being silenced by the archives.

Another thing that I found interesting was that once it is found that a group does not have a voice the archives want to fill in the gap and include them. This can lead to even marginalizing the group further because of the Romanticization of the group and therefor not representing the whole group and they can potentially keep the group marginalized instead of helping. As the archives are trying to do. This also leads to the next point that I never thought about which is that sometimes the silences is actually wanted by a group of people as a tool of resistance. That this their only tool to show that the group is being repressed by the powerful. It is not that their voices have been deliberately left out, but they use silence to be subtly and infuriate the oppressors. 

The point that I found least interesting is the fact archival silence can be disastrous to the marginalized groups. This is because even though the groups might be left out of the mainstream archives it does not mean they do not hold on to records in other ways or in their own archives. Now yes will the group fall into oblivion if they are not at least mentioned in mainstream archives I believe so, but it is also its their choice to be silenced and to not have their voice heard in protest to the powerful. 






### Questions 
Does the Archives have to give a voice to a marginalized group, or should they at least mention the group especially when the silence is an active thing the group is doing?

Will giving everyone a voice in the archives actually hurt the people that have been left out?
