# Voices of the Silent
## _exploring the ways missing archival records can still speak for a people_


To be the quiet one in a room is often a comfortable seat, but it is a forgettable one. The work put into some achievement, grand or privately small, will be left to the dust if not heard in some way. The Archives of history can naturally hold only a limited amount of information. Leaving many quiet spots in history. Thus is the sad acceptance of something being, “lost to history.” However, a way to hear those sometimes-quiet voices can still exist according to this week’s reading. 

Proving a voice is absent from the archives is the first step in acknowledging that the chair in the corner was occupied and the story told from there had validity and reason to be remembered.  The “poetics of exclusion,” coined by David Greetham, works around the diligent and underhand pursuit of omission of groups and people marginalized in society. Repairing the missing links in historical records can be done by recording the information available that has survived through time.  This could come about by the gathering of stories from those who keep ancestral records. Adding family histories can fill the empty spaces. Natural criticism of this would be concerns of biased and stories handed down may be in accurate. One way to ease the mind of those who might be concerned with an inaccuracy of details could be in knowing that at least some representation of a previously unrecorded story has been recorded. 

This may not be an appropriate means of representation. We do run the risk of seeing things from our own current point of view. Speaking for another, as the reading points out, is further victimizing the marginalized. We do have the reasonability to act respectable towards the quiet spaces in history. 

The balance of power is still sought by the recording of voices and the silencing of others. Awareness of this act in all its forms corrects some behavior now on a social level. Part of any historian’s job could be the active improvement of current time while reflecting on past events. Gathering stories now can transform the silence into representation.
