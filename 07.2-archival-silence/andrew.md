# Reflections on Carter, Archival Silence

There were a number of concepts in Carter’s article I found interesting, though chief among them is probably the idea of _“listening to silences”_ in an effort to uncover the untold, forgotten, or actively suppressed histories of marginalized communities. It’s rather intuitive to approach archives as a neutral site for data gathering, though as we discussed earlier in the week these sites are almost always curated to impart some kind of historical bias on the researcher. To remedy this, researchers must be critical of the information that is stored within archives and ask ourselves what power structures enabled its preservation and what power structures does it continue to uphold. Carter encourages us to go a step further when examining archives, _not only must we critically investigate the information present within archives, but so must we interrogate archives for the information they leave out._ After all, archives are shaped by what information they decide to exclude, and therefore the memory of lost histories exists within the gaps of historical archives. Carter calls this idea _”absent-presence”_ , and while it may seem a difficult concept at first, we actually practice linking absence to presence all the time. Consider how we notice when peers are absent from class, or our car is absent from our driveway – it’s only through recognizing their absence we can remember their presence to begin with. So goes it with the quest to uncover forgotten histories, stories which are housed in the gaps within our archives. 

Another idea I found worthy of discussion in Carter’s article was how researchers must take conscious steps to avoid further damaging the historical footprint of marginalized communities, meaning that we must be extremely careful when it comes to documenting and labeling these histories. In particular, Carter notes how the act of creating a record of a people’s history can often alter the purpose of that history. So, for instance, even if Native American history was further emphasized in American public education, little good would come of it if tribal histories were used only to further an exceptionalist agenda. Archivists can unconsciously further victimize underrepresented groups if they are not cautious in their approach to record keeping. In other words, we must be careful not to speak for marginalized peoples as we attempt to record their stories. _Rather than inserting them into our existing narrative, we need to invite those groups relegated to the edges of history into the practice of archiving, thus giving them a voice in terms of access and use of their own stories._

Finally, the notion of _deliberately maintaining silence as an act of resistance to hegemony_ is something I found quite striking. Counter to what we might think initially, silence is not always forced upon people, but rather we can choose to use silence as a tool for our benefit. Carter cites how feminist activists refused to take part in or lend their voices to the _“partiarchive”_ as it collected only the stories that furthered a male-dominated historical narrative. What like most about this idea is how Carter characterizes the act of invoking silence _not as “power over” but as “power with”_, meaning that to use silence as a tool of protest is not to seek control over the historical narrative, but to cooperatively empower a community to resist that narrative from being imposed upon them. 

Questions: 

_1. How can researchers fill in the gaps of our archives without perpetuating the harmful narratives archives create?_

_2. How can historians work to uncover the difference between natural and unnatural silence exhibited by marginalized communities throughout time?_
