I had never thought about or imagined the sheer power of the silence. As a personal interest of mine during the period of Ancient Greece I was aware of the few resources we had still today. I had not put thought into the power of preserving what was deemed at the time very important. Words have power and when reading the voice of those outside the Ancient Greek power vacuum were regulated toward **oblivion**, I paused for a moment.

**Oblivion?** I may never know what many people thought, believed, wrote, or declared. I think I take for granted new information being discovered, but some information won't be found. I expanded that thought onto several points of history. The silence is powerful. You couldn’t possibly capture every story within an archive. Even the most spirited and eager archivist is human. Stories will be left out and those stories will quite possibly fade. That is both humbling and terrifying to me.

I do believe that *finding the voices* in the silence is a step in the right direction. The fact that the search for that voice exists is hopeful. What I found particularly interesting was listening to this silence. We can determine what is missing, why isn’t this group or this person mentioned? Asking questions and analyzing seems to once again be an important theme in navigating the silence.

**Power** often steers the conversation. Power often dictates who can or can’t speak up. That narrative has been present throughout history but we have the opportunity to re-examine instances and allow us to try and find those voices. We just have to be careful to not allow the powerful present voices to paint the picture, especially speaking for these marginalized groups.


1. How can a historian make silenced voices present when retelling a historical story, with little to no resources?
2. Online elements have made family trees, blogs, and journals easier to share will this help in more voices being saved?
