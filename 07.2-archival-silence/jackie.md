## Nothing is ever straightforward and easy, is it?!

It is clear from our readings this week that Archives, much like history and historiography, are a complex and often heavily biased system that often immortalizes individual and collective memories and ideals. Once established, change (progress?) can be slow and tedious, but it is not impossible. 

I am a strong proponent for Archives and archival work, based on the wonderful experiences I have had when using them suit my needs. This is a prime example of the privalege that I carry as well as the power that Archives have in shaping knowledge and memory, and although they are often correlated, power and privalege do not always have to be viewed as a negative thing. 

The pre-postmodern Archive is often viewed as this hulking, exclusive institution that is the overlord of the world's information, but are postmodern Archives that much different? Instead of a few behemouth examples of all encompasing Archives as in the past, now we have a significant increase in the amount of specialized Archives. But are they really any more inclusive in the types of records they collect? 

The Canadian Women's Movement Archives and the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives provide essential, useful, missing insight to the overall history of these topics, but they are still inclusive representations of those topics. It's unlikely for you to find a plethora of information regarding the construction of the Canadian railway lines in the 1800s in these archives, unless there is a direct link to the women's or LGBTQIA+ community. 

These days, I think it is incredibly important for students of history to know about Archives and archival practices both from the lens of the past and well as the present. Finding information through just one historical source has been discouraged for centuries, and so the same should be for utilizing sources from just one Archival source. 

"Smaller" Archives which focus on collections that are comprised of niche topics should be championed in this postmodern era. Potential biases may remain, but if the overall archival "institution" is broken up and utilized this way, it allows the archivists to focus on filling in the gaps of (willing) marginalized communities, as well as students of history to advance their perspective by visiting multiple Archives. 

A few questions:
1. How do you think Archives can provide a fuller picture and incorportate willing communities? 
2. Do you think that Archival practices need to drastically change in order to become more inclusive?
