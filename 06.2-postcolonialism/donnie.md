# The Identity of Self
## _Knowing who we are by removal of where we are_

To search for one’s identity is a daunting task that is often influenced by our surroundings, place in time, and gender. At times, these boundaries are pierced and a path previously unknown to the individual is sought. Identification through nationality is a common way of identifying self. However, this identity may not be true if forced upon one place by another. Nationality them becomes a superficial identity that may or may not be who someone really is.  

People go unaware that it is individuals who make up the political construct of nationality. However, we could presume millions throughout time, but probable more, have had to seek an identity as that of lesser than. Defined somewhat to the side of the national identity they are situated to geographically speaking. This adds to the need to express oneself either in relation to or exact opposite of the presumed identity. 

In the searching for identity that Dipesh Chakrabarty takes us through in, “Postcoloniality and the Artifice of History: Who Speaks for the ‘Indian’ Pasts?” the longing for that identity is traced through finding place and practice among the historical events of the time one is placed. Especially if you happen to be living in a colonized country, or female. European culture was placed upon many as the highest means of living in a dignified matter and relating one’s identity and self-worth to this idea. 

Frustration with these ideas was the starting point historically for the inclusion and expansion of people who express or identify in ways other than the predominantly popular voices of the time. It was a battle fought inwardly as well as in the streets of time. Only recently in our own time do we have what seems to be an expansion of inclusion.

 In the commingling of history and present time, and the question of which one is affecting the other, the ability for society to grow from one another, greater representation is needed. If we expand identity matters for the purpose of now, to make our current recording of events a more harmonious one, we can shape the experience of the people of this time and perhaps change the story recorded for future historians. 
 


- Can we identify who we are as a unique individual outside of any preconceived notions? 
- Have we moved beyond a European class identity, or do we simply identify as opposite of this notion thus still including it within our identity by way omission?
