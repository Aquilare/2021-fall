Here postcoloniality is describing the way that India was treated by European powers, most notably Britain. During the period of colonization and even after Britain controlled lots of the writing about Indias history, in both style and content. History is more than just events, and can justify peoples culture. The Britains writing paints India as a backyard “third world country” in need of help and advancement only the British can provide. The colonial history is mainly the justification for colonizing these people, and trying to detail how these people need to be “civilized”. 


I think that the main challenges to postcolonial history is trying to separate the colonizer from the history after so long. It would be difficult to separate not only the events and history, but also the opinions and way of thinking. Postcolonial writers have the task of not only helping to create an independent identity from the colonizers, but also having to differentiate between the history of their nation as they used to see it, and the history that the colonizers wrote and spread. 


Questions
1. Is it possible to separate the colonial writings from that chapter of Indias history, and how will they write about that part of their history? 
2. Can you ever go back to the way it was precolonial, or will the history always be touched by colonizers?
