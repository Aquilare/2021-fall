Reading reflection

What is the premise of post coloniality as described here? 

I think the premise of post coloniality as described by Dipesh Chakrabarty is how the third world is treated compared to Europe or the European understanding of the world. “Europe” remains the sovereign theoretical subject for all histories, including the one’s we call “Indian,” “Chinese.” “Kenyan” and so on.” (page 2) As I was reading this I kept thinking about our past readings on Enlightenment thinking and how those thinkers believed that there way of thinking was the ideal or the standard for the rest of the world so things like colonialism and empire would be allowed to take place as long as it was done in the name of progress with enlightenment ideals. 

Chakrabarty also mentions the transition narrative that the third world or parts of the world that are not like Europe must go through to become better or more civilized. “Most modern third world histories are written within problematics posed by this transition narrative of which the overriding (if often implicit) themes are those of development, modernization, capitalism.” (page.5) I feel kind of the same way with that narrative that these people are just not up to the task that there needs to be some intervention (European) to get these people to where they need to be to experience progress. Chakrabarty says “When it was first formulated in colonial histories of India, this transition narrative was an unashamed celebration of imperialists capacity for violence and conquest.” (page 5) This is an important point about violence being a central tenet of colonialism it’s a feature that is used to bring the conquered people into the light with the knowledge and customs of the conquerors. 


What are the main challenges to a postcolonial history? 

Some of the main challenges for a postcolonial history are the how they are incomplete they can be and how hard it is to untangle the history from the transition narrative that is easy to embrace because it shows a linear path where progress should be the result of this course. Another obstacle is how can you write a post-colonial history without it becoming nationalized? Is it possible to write about a nation state without it becoming romanticized? It’s an issue we have been discussing and class and it comes up again here in the reading as well. 

Questions 

What are ways that the third world can view progress without the standard of Europe? 

Is academic history flawed due to its Eurocentric bias? Can you even attempt to reform it or are the bias set in and cannot be changed?
