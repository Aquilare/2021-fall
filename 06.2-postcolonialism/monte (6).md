The inescapable theme that seemed to resonate throughout the writing by Chakrabarty was modernization. The idea of transformation through perceived “*advancements*”. The historic model of progress that Europe often uses is argued to only show a European view of India and the idea that the period before European involvement was mythological or even medieval as the reading described. In that way, relating it to a past period of European history.

We see the view of a religious dominated history and the idea that Europeans moved these countries from an idea they tried to remove themself over hundreds of years. Another example of a European idea that pressed onto other groups in order to as stated before “*modernize the thinking*”. 

Escaping the idea that countries including India were able to reach this point of “modern” after European involvement paints a very particular picture that isn’t exactly allowing that history to flourish on it’s own. The British occupation targeted the people within the country with a focus on the labor class.

We see a system in which wealthy elites exist within the colonized country and as they began following the European pattern they received less criticism than the poor and working class people of these countries. These people needed to embrace this new modern society more than most according to this idea of thinking. While the idea of needing European influence in order for India to progress past needing outside involvement is mentioned, I think this continues to focus on European involvement, while discrediting the thinkers of India.

How do historians detangle themselves from the history of India, the nation and the history of people in the region? **Can they**? With the abundance of documented material from the colonial period can these nations escape the looming shadow of European influence, especially with Western culture providing little motivation to do so.

1. Why do we lack education or curriculum on cultures outside of the Americas? How could that change?
2. How do we find the line between nationalism dominated history and allowing a country to find it’s historical independent voice?
