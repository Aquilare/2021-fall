### Postcolonial Histories
Dipesh Chakrabarty in my option is arguing that postcolonial history needs to break away from the standard academic way of looking at the past. This is because the narrative puts non-European countries as less then European counterparts because of being under the rule of European powers. It is a history of subjugation and is not really “their history”. Dipesh Chakrabarty states that “Histories that aim to displace a hyperreal Europe from the center … will have to seek out relentlessly this connection between violence and idealism that lies at the hear of the process by which the narratives of citizenship and modernity come to find a natural home in ‘history’” (page 22). Meaning that the history of progress has to be abandoned in order for the history of colonialized places to write their own histories without going back to the same tropes. 

There are many issues facing postcolonial historian one being the fact that the histories are incomplete. That a lot of the different past have been boiled down to fit the European narrative of transitions. Another issue for postcolonialism historians is a lack of private life. For example, in India autobiographies are very public and that any confessional writing is absent from them. Another issue is the antihistorical memory and histories which comes from universities helping keep the European narrative of history. They are able to do this because of how things were documented during the colonial time period. 

What this brings to writing history is that there are many times that history has been written to mimic European ways of writing that leads to a sub servitude history in places that are not European. This mean that in Dipesh Chakrabarty mind you have to find other links that are not tied to standard methods of looking at history. That you do not need to write history using the themes of citizenship and the nation state. 




### Questions 
Why would former colonize countries still look toward Europe as the gold standard instead of looking to their own past?

How does one write postcolonial history when there are only bias documents and antihistorical memory and still get approval from your peers?
