Third-world histories are written with overriding themes of development, modernization and capitalism.  Europe is viewed as the standard by which to judge Indian historical studies.  The end of deep impoverishment, social revolution and the transformation of the underlying social structure into a thriving capitalist society = *modernization*.  Viewed by outside and erroneous contexts, early Indian history consisted of mythological and religious themes, while the European version was based on logic and reason.

Indian history had been viewed in terms of how the British colonists could “civilize” the region by implementing new technologies (railways) and introducing European concepts of bourgeoisie lifestyles to a distinctly “backwards” culture.  This process was enabled by the colonial proclivity for violence as a means to control and then lay bare a nation for colonization (they become “formed for passive obedience”, p. 6).

The inadequacy of these colonized societies was heaved upon the lower-classes, the peasants and workers who were seen as ignorant and needed education and “reform”.  Citizenship became the goal of a modern India, and was made a part of the postcolonial Indian constitution, which Chakrabarty says is a “farce”.  One example of this ideal was in the colonial British insistence on order and discipline/cleanliness in the domestic sphere, which as we read, was greatly criticized by the colonists in regard to traditional Indian domestic roles and standards.  The role of women in marriage becomes one of a modern view, as a friend (or companionate) and women become people with a new “freedom” which was not how marriage was traditionally viewed (arranged marriages).

The lack of a formal Indian nation state prior to British colonization was one of the reasons that building a sense of nationalism or national identity has been critical in the Indian postcolonial era. “Nations” are viewed as capable of creating histories, enforcing narratives about their own pasts, which in turn become part of the education of the citizenry.  The ideals of citizenship are fully entangled in this notion of a nation, and are part of the challenges to creating a more inclusive historical narrative of postcolonial India.

Postcoloniality, according to Chakrabarty, is faced with the greatest challenge of firmly establishing a formerly colonized society’s own **independent** identity.  This would include the notion of “modernizing” a society, but according to their own terms and standards, essentially that means allowing for that group/culture to create their own definitions of what modernity is and if they have or are achieving that. 

Chakrabarty argues for an historic narrative that includes all of the negative issues that surround colonial histories (violence, repression, and the political and cultural strategies used to maintain control over those who are oppressed).

*Questions for consideration-*

Why has nationalism become the precept by which most modern histories are written?

Can postcolonial histories become more accurate narratives of a pre and postcolonial identity?
